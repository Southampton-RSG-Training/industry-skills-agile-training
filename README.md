# Industry Software Development Skills course

This course teaches skills for professional software development,
focusing on technical product development and delivery using the [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/) agile method of working, integrating technical skills with professional competencies.
Participants work on a technical project through multiple sprints, practicing agile principles, feature branch workflow using Git version control, process-aware software development, testing, and releasing software, while enhancing team collaboration, communication and adaptability.

This course and its curriculum is motivated by results from the [Digital and Professional Skills for Industry: Understanding Employers and Graduate Experiences](https://zenodo.org/records/15006033) gap study conducted by the [UK Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk),
which identified skills gaps in UK graduates transitioning into software engineering and data science roles within industry and the public sector.

## Lesson Status

The course is in a pre-alpha piloting phase.
