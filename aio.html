</h3>
<p>Traditionally in academia, software and the process of writing it is
often seen as a necessary but throwaway artefact in research. For
example, there may be research questions for a given research project,
code is created to answer those questions, the code is run over some
data and analysed, and finally a publication is written based on those
results. These steps are often taken informally.</p>
<p>The terms <em>programming</em> (or even <em>coding</em>) and
<em>software engineering</em> are often used interchangeably. They are
not. Programmers or coders tend to focus on one part of software
development: implementation, more than any other. In academic research,
often they are writing software for themselves, where they are their own
stakeholders. And ideally, they write software from a design that
fulfills a research goal to publish research papers.</p>
<p>Someone who is engineering software takes a wider view:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>lifecycle</em> of software: recognises that software
development is a <em>process</em> that proceeds from understanding what
is needed, to writing the software and using/releasing it, to what
happens afterwards.</li>
<li>Who will (or may) be involved: software is written for
<em>stakeholders</em>. This may only be the researcher initially, but
there is an understanding that others may become involved later (even if
that is not evident yet). A good rule of thumb is to always assume that
code will be read and used by others later on, which includes
yourself!</li>
<li>Software (or code) is an asset: software inherently contains value -
for example, in terms of what it can do, the lessons learned throughout
its development, and as an implementation of a research approach (i.e. a
particular research algorithm, process, or technical approach).</li>
<li>As an asset, it could be reused: again, it may not be evident
initially that the software will have use beyond its initial purpose or
project, but there is an assumption that the software - or even just a
part of it - could be reused in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking about software engineering from that wider view, there are
some typical stages that a software development project would go through
and these are ver similar to the stages of any project.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p><strong>Solo Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Think about a project you’ve completed in the past. This could be a
software project but it doesn’t have to be. It could be anything from
organising an event to completing a personal goal or managing a work
task.</p>
<p>If you were to break down that project into stages, what would the
stages be?</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="software-development-process">Software Development Process<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#software-development-process"></a>
</h3>
<p>The typical stages of a software development process are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Requirements gathering:</strong> the process of identifying
and recording the exact requirements for a software project before it
begins. This helps maintain a clear direction throughout development,
and sets clear targets for what the software needs to do.</li>
<li>
<strong>Design:</strong> where the requirements are translated into
an overall design for the software. It covers what will be the basic
software ‘components’ and how they will fit together, as well as the
tools and technologies that will be used, which will together address
the requirements identified in the first stage.</li>
<li>
<strong>Implementation:</strong> the software is developed according
to the design, implementing the solution that meets the requirements set
out in the requirements gathering stage.</li>
<li>
<strong>Testing:</strong> the software is tested with the intent to
discover and rectify any defects, and also to ensure that the software
meets its defined requirements, i.e. does it actually do what it should
do reliably?</li>
<li>
<strong>Deployment:</strong> where the software is deployed or in
some way released, and used for its intended purpose within its intended
environment.</li>
<li>
<strong>Maintenance:</strong> where updates are made to the software
to ensure it remains fit for purpose, which typically involves fixing
any further discovered issues and evolving it to meet new or changing
requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>These stages are followed implicitly or explicitly in every software
project but there are many different ways to arrange them. The stages
may be arranged according to an established model of software
development.</p>

<figure><img src="fig/waterfall.png" alt="diagram of the waterfall model" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The Waterfall Model is a software development methodology in which
the typical stages of the software development process (that we outlined
above) are followed step-by-step in a set, sequential order.</p>
<p>The Waterfall Model is effective when used for projects where the
requirements are clearly defined from the outset. It is ideal for
projects with long timelines and minimal tolerance for errors, where
stakeholders require high confidence in the final outcome.</p>

Crossrail project</a> (later rebranded as the Elizabeth Line) used a
Waterfall approach of clear, sequential phases. This approach was
appropriate because the requirements were known from the start, with
little possibility for change throughout the project. The line spans
118km, serving 41 stations (10 new) and had been used for over 500
million journeys by early 2025 since its opening in 2022. Despite the
project delays and overspend, the Elizabeth Line was widely praised as
an engineering triumph.</p>

<li>The model is relatively inflexible. Once a phase is completed, the
model does not account for going back to make changes and therefore
there is no mechanism for error correction.</li>
<li>The model assumes that project requirements are fully defined from
the beginning, which is rarely the case for smaller, non-critical
software projects, particularly in research.</li>
<li>The software is not seen by the client until late in the project
timeline, which may increase the risk of it not meeting the client’s
expectations.</li>

<p>The myki ticketing system was designed to replace the Metcard system

July 2005.</p>
<p>The project was expected to be completed in two years but ended up
taking over nine years in total and the budgeted cost was exceeded by
55%. Furthermore, due to the rigidly fixed scope and upfront planning,
the system could not adapt to evolving user expectations or new
technologies. The system was plagued by multiple issues including
overcharging, slow touch readers, top-up delays and limited device
compatibility.</p>
<p>These issues were all symptomatic of the inflexible development

<p>The concept of the V-model was developed simultaneously, but
independently, in Germany and in the United States in the late
1980s.</p>
<p>The V-Model emphasises the importance of validating each level of the
software development. This approach ensures that verification (checking
work during development) and validation (checking final products against
requirements) are systematically integrated throughout the process.</p>
<p>The left side of the V includes creation and verification steps,
i.e. does it work according to the specification.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Requirements gathering</p></li>
<li><p>System design</p></li>
<li><p>Architectural design</p></li>
<li><p>Module design</p></li>
<li><p>Coding</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The right side of the V includes validation for each step, i.e. have
you built the right thing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unit testing (validation for module design)</p></li>
<li><p>Integration testing (validation for architectural
design)</p></li>
<li><p>System testing (validation for system design)</p></li>
<li><p>User acceptance testing (validation for requirements
gathering)</p></li>

<p>In many cases, it doesn’t make sense for software development to
follow a linear process such as the Waterfall or V model for a number of
reasons. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes to a design mean that the requirements must be adjusted</li>
<li>A company may build on the same project for years, adding more
complexity</li>
<li>The design of a key algorithm may need changing, leading to a need
to change the implementation</li>
<li>A mistake is could be found during deployment which requires changes
to the implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>In iterative development, a large application is built in smaller,
manageable parts called iterations. Each iteration includes planning,
design, development, and testing, and produces a working version of the
product. Unlike the Waterfall and V models, where the entire product is
developed at once, iterative development adds features incrementally,
with each cycle enhancing the functionality of the product.</p>

<p>The Spiral Model, sometimes known as Boehm’s Spiral, is an iterative,
risk-driven approach to software development. The approach allows for
any mixture of software development approaches depending on the pattern
of risk present in the project. The model guides users to first
determine objectives, second identify and resolve risks, third develop
and test, and fourth plan the next iteration. More recently, the spiral
model has been thought of as a ‘process model generator’ because Boehm
argues that choices based on a project’s risks generate an appropriate
process model for the project.</p>
<p>Decisions about how much effort should be directed into each element
of the project is guided by the goal of minimising the overall risk.</p>

<h4 id="agile">Agile<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#agile"></a>
</h4>
<p>Agile software development is a phrase used to describe any iterative
method which broadly follows a set of principles determined by a group
of 17 software developers, called the Agile Alliance, at a meeting in
Utah in 2001. These principles, outlined in the Manifesto for Agile
Software Development, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</p></li>
<li><p>Working software over comprehensive documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</p></li>
<li><p>Responding to change over following a plan</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Agile Manifesto was inspired by the desire for a more rapid and
lightweight approach to software development, as an alternative to the
more heavyweight processes such as Waterfall and V-Model. It drew on
ideas from existing lightweight software development methods such as
rapid application development, the rational unified process aka RUP,
dynamic systems development method, scrum, extreme programming and
feature driven development. Although these methods were developed in the
1990s, before the Agile Manifesto, they are now all referred to under
the umbrella term ‘Agile’ and, with the exception of Scrum, these
methods have now gone out of fashion.</p>

<p>Advantages of Iterative Development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Progress on the software product can initially be faster as less
time is spent on the requirements and design stages before starting
implementation</li>
<li>Iterative approaches allow for continuous feedback, adaptation, and
improvement throughout the project’s lifecycle.</li>
<li>Defects can be found and corrected early, preventing them from
affecting later stages.</li>
<li>After each iteration, feedback can be gathered from users, allowing
for adjustments and improvements to meet their expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages of Iterative Development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without fully determined requirements and design, software can
become messy or ‘hacky’ if quality control standards are not
maintained</li>
<li>Since not all requirements are defined from the start, unforeseen
changes may arise during the development process which require revision
of the software architecture, costing more time in the long run.</li>

<p>Any model can be used for any software development project. Waterfall
and V-Model and more likely to be used when all the requirements are
known at the start of the project. Iterative methods are particularly
suited to prototyping, where quick development and user feedback help
shape early versions of a system, and to research software, where
evolving requirements and experimental objectives demand adaptability.
However, iterative approaches can be used on any project including those
which are large scale and safety critical.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that, to some extent, linear approaches become
iterative in reality, as it is nearly always necessary to return to
previous stages throughout the software development process. For
example, knowing 100% of the requirements from the start is nearly
always impossible. Even if a waterfall approach is applied, changes will
most likely be made at each of the stages, requiring revision of an
earlier stage.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Scrum is an Agile delivery technique that guides the actual software
development process. Scrum is concerned with delivering a project
i.e. doing the actual software engineering.</p>
<p>Project management is concerned with all aspects of a project
including planning, executing, and closing projects, as well as managing
change and risk within a project. Project management may contain Scrum
but will also cover the wider project aspects including ensuring that a
project meets its goals, timeline, and budget.</p>
<p>There are lots of project management frameworks.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion we should distinguish between Scrum (an Agile
delivery technique) and Agile Project Management (AgilePM), which
involves the application of Agile principles to managing projects.
AgilePM emphasises transparency, flexibility and meeting customer need,
as well as allowing teams to have autonomy, make shared decisions and
self-organise.</p>
<p>Another popular project management framework is PRINCE2 (PRojects IN
Controlled Environments), which was developed by the UK government, and
outlines seven principles, seven themes and seven processes to guide how
a project should be managed. It is a more heavyweight project management
framework than Agile Project Management and so is often used in sectors
where governance and documentation are priorities.</p>

perspective of the client</li>
<li>
<em>Requirements</em>, which state what needs to be built (or what
needs to change) by the development team</li>
</ul>
<p>So whilst they both capture what the software will do, each reflects
one side of the client/developer perspective.</p>

Perspective<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#user-stories-understanding-what-is-needed-from-the-user-perspective"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Capturing “requirements” is pivotal to understanding what needs to be
built, but whilst they state what is technically required, they lack the
end-user context of what they are and why they are important. User
stories aim to capture this perspective, being short and simple
descriptions of new features or functionality from the perspective of
the end user themselves. Therefore, user stories help:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project remains <em>user-centered</em> and <em>focused on real
needs</em>, rather than jumping prematurely to solution or technical
requirements</li>
<li>To clarify the the <em>value</em> behind a feature, and anchor
development in <em>user outcomes</em>, not just functionality</li>
<li>Prevent requirements ballooning, if not guided by real user
goals</li>
<li>Prioritise what matters to users</li>
</ul>
<p>They typically follow the following template, to ensure user stories
are clear and concise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a <em>[type of user]</em>, I want <em>[an action]</em> so that
<em>[benefit]</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<li>“As a <em>[type of user]</em>”: who are we building this for? There
may be more than one type of user, but in any case we need to think
about this from the user’s perspective.</li>
<li>“I want <em>[an action]</em>”: this describes the intent of this
type of user, not the features of the system. What do they want to
achieve?</li>
<li>“so that <em>[benefit]</em>”: what is the benefit they are trying to
realise? How will it help them directly, solve a problem for them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of user stories include:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-commerce site: as a shopper, I want to add items to my cart so
that I can purchase multiple products at once</li>
<li>Mobile application: as a user, I want to receive push notifications
for important updates so that I stay informed when I’m not using the
app</li>

<p>Consider this scenario:</p>
<p><em>“A small town cheese-making business has received many enquiries
about being able to make online purchases delivered to their homes or
place of business, and so now want to also sell their many types of
cheeses using an online store. Online customers are looking to be able
to search the store, select cheeses to purchase, and when ready, add
payment and shipping details and confirm the order. There is some
evidence that some online customers are environmentally and ecologically
conscious, so are interested in the environmental impacts of products.
In order to schedule their supply chains efficiently, business customers
are keen to have updates on shipping. From the perspective of the
business owner, they want to able to manage available stock inventory on
the online store.”</em></p>
<p>Identify at least two types of user - also known as <em>personas</em>
- that would use the store. From the above scenario, create at least
four user stories using this format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a <em>[type of user]</em>, I want <em>[an action]</em> so that
<em>[benefit]</em>.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In general, a requirement is a <em>capability or condition that must
be met for software to solve a problem or address a need</em>. They form
the foundation of our project and drive what will be developed, so if we
do not properly explore and understand what is required, the software
will not be suitable for it’s intended purpose.</p>
<p>Whilst user stories focus purely on the user perspective,
requirements concentrate on what technically needs to change. For this
reason, it’s common to develop user stories first (to understand the
user), then from those stories, derive requirements (to understand what
needs to be built). Requirements typically address technical aspects of
software functionality and features that are needed to complete a user
story, and are more numerous than the collection of user stories.
Therefore, each user story is often addressed by more than one
requirement.</p>
<p>There is repeated evidence that most errors aren’t actually
introduced during the software development stage, but during
requirements analysis and design. For example, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ISRE.1993.324825" class="external-link">one analysis</a> of the
software errors uncovered during integration and testing and the Voyager
(1977) and Galileo (1989) probes discovered that 79% of these errors
were due to a poor understanding of requirements.</p>
<p>However, it is unlikely that we will be able to determine all of the
requirements correctly and completely upfront. In practice, very often
requirements may need be flexible to some extent and may change as the
project evolves, so we need to ensure we are able to accommodate any
agreed changes.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="requirements-are-more-than-just-features">Requirements are More than just Features<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#requirements-are-more-than-just-features"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>When considering software requirements, it is very tempting to just
think about the features users need. However, many design choices in a
software project depend on the users themselves and the environment in
which the software is expected to run (as well as <em>how</em> the
software should run), and these aspects should be considered as part of
the software’s <em>non-functional</em> requirements.</p>
<p>To explore the importance of this aspect, let’s consider two software
types, mobile applications and embedded software. They may appear
similar, but examining the environments in which they are developed and
operate uncovers many differences that need to be accounted for in order
for the software to be fit for purpose.</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col width="26%">
<col width="30%">
<col width="42%">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr class="header">
<th>Concern</th>
<th>Mobile Apps</th>
<th>Embedded Software</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Platform</td>
<td>Work on range of mobile hardware and iOS/Android operating
systems</td>
<td>Exact specification of hardware is known - often not necessary to
support multiple devices; typically low power</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Development Language</td>
<td>Typically written in one of the higher-level platform preferred
languages (e.g. Java, Kotlin, Swift)</td>
<td>Typically lower-level language (e.g. C) for better control of
resources</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Compilation</td>
<td>Users will not (usually) modify / compile the software</td>
<td>Users will not (usually) modify / compile the software</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>Installation</td>
<td>Usually distributed via a controlled app store</td>
<td>Usually distributed pre-installed on a physical device</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Interface</td>
<td>Must have graphical interface suitable for a touch display</td>
<td>May have no user interface, or interface may be physical
buttons</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Documentation</td>
<td>Probably in the software itself or on a Web page</td>
<td>Documentation probably in a technical manual with a separate user
manual</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Uptime</td>

<td>May need to run continuously for the lifetime of the device</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Therefore, whilst a single piece of software may provide the same
<em>functionality</em> on a mobile app or embedded device (for example,
a photo frame application), the other <em>non-functional</em>
considerations describe facets of how the software must be developed and
how it must operate (often as constraints), and we must account for them
in our requirements.</p>

<p>Think about some software you are familiar with (could be software
you have written yourself or by someone else) and how the environment it
is used in has affected its design or development. Here are some
examples of questions you can use to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>What environment does the software run in?</li>
<li>How do people interact with it?</li>
<li>What features of the software have been affected by these
factors?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Has a graphical interface for use with mouse and keyboard</li>
<li>May need to work on multiple, very different operating systems</li>
<li>May be intended for users to modify / compile themselves</li>

<p>Command-line Application - High Performance Computing</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to a UNIX Tool</li>
<li>Usually supports running across multiple networked machines
simultaneously</li>
<li>Usually operated via a scheduler - interface should be
scriptable</li>
<li>May need to run on a wide range of hardware (e.g. different CPU
architectures)</li>
<li>May need to process large amounts of data</li>
<li>Often entirely or partially written in a lower-level language for

</ul>
<p>Web Application</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually has components which run on server and components which run
on the user’s device</li>
<li>Graphical interface should usually support both Desktop and Mobile
devices</li>
<li>Client-side component should run on a range of browsers and

<p>A <em>product backlog</em> is a prioritised list of functionality
that a product should contain; essentially, a list of work for the
development team. It represents everything that might be needed in the
product and is the single source of truth for all work. They include
requirement-related aspects such as features, bugs, improvements, and
non-functional requirements, but also any other supporting tasks such as
any needed research (also known as <em>spikes</em>), and other
implementation-related tasks (like cleaning up/refactoring code).</p>
<p>A product backlog is owned by the <em>product owner</em> (the
client), and is dynamic, in that it evolves as the needs of the product
evolves. Regular backlog refinement sessions throughout a project ensure
items are updated, estimated, re-prioritised if necessary, and ready for
upcoming sprints.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Managing our issues as presented in the <code>Issues</code> page is
helpful as a view to everything that’s being done, but it gives a
relative flat representation of tasks and it’s not straightforward to
determine, at a glance, the overall status of a project. In
particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s still to do</li>
<li>What’s currently in progress</li>
<li>What’s been completed</li>
</ul>
<p>This is particularly the case when we have many issues for a given
project, and more than one person working on them.</p>
<p>In an agile Scrum sense, if we’re currently in a sprint (or preparing
for one in a sprint planning session) it would be beneficial to have a
way to visualise and manage this information efficiently. GitHub does
provide <em>Milestones</em> as an organisational mechanism, where we are
able to group issues together in logical lists, but this approach also
has similar limitations at scale. In addition, a key technique in agile
approaches is frequent prioritisation, and that’s difficult to do
without a higher-level approach.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="github-projects">GitHub Projects<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#github-projects"></a>
</h3>
<p>GitHub Projects enable ways of organising issues into smaller
“sub-projects” (i.e. smaller than the “project” represented by the whole
repository). Projects provide a way of visualising and organising work
which is not time-bound and is on a higher level, which makes management
easier.</p>
<p>Milestones are typically used to organise lower-level tasks that have
deadlines and progress of which needs to be closely tracked
(e.g. release and version management). The main difference is that
Milestones are a repository-level feature (i.e. they belong and are
managed from a single repository), whereas projects are account-level,
and can manage tasks across many repositories under the same user or
organisational account. This is particularly useful for larger projects
with development across multiple repositories (for example, with
client-side code in one repository and server-side code in another).
This enables the development team to manage issues on these repositories
under a single project board, if desired.</p>
<p>Conceptually, for our purposes a GitHub Project is a “project board”,
which originated as a tool used by Toyota in the 1940s called the
“Kanban” system. Kanban-style boards consists of columns and cards to
keep track of tasks. You break down your project into smaller
sub-projects, which in turn are split into tasks which you write on
cards, then move the cards between columns that describe the status of
each task. Cards are usually small, descriptive and self-contained tasks
that build on each other. Breaking a project down into clearly-defined
tasks makes it a lot easier to manage.</p>
<p>In GitHub, a project board adopts this Kanban-style, with entries on
the board either being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Cards</em> - a short note which belongs only to the Project
Board</li>
<li>
<em>Issues</em> - essentially GitHub issues imported from a
repository (or many repositories)</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as a Kanban-style boards, GitHub Projects also supports other
types of view too, including roadmap views, table-based views, or as a
spreadsheet. For the purposes of this training, we’ll use the boards
view.</p>

<p>To use a project board in GitHub, it needs to be created and shared

<p>Firstly, select one of the team to create the board, who will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>On the group repository’s main page, select <code>Projects</code>,
then <code>New Project</code>. <img src="fig/github-board-project-link.png" class="image-with-shadow figure" alt="Link to create a project board" width="1000">

<p>Similarly to how the repository was shared with the rest of the

<li>Select <code>Manage access</code> from the navigation bar on the

<li>Under <code>Invite collaborators</code>, add each member of the
group by adding their username.</li>
<li>Set each member’s permissions under <code>Manage access</code> to
<code>Write</code> or <code>Admin</code> so they are able to make
changes to the board.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once created, you should see the default layout for a GitHub board,
with three columns: <code>Todo</code>, <code>In Progress</code>, and

them.</p>

continue to add arbitrary text, this will create a board card, but
instead, we want to add issues from our repository. To do this, type

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Once we have an initial set of requirements captured, we need to
understand their importance in relation to each other: essentially we
need to prioritise them.</p>
<p>But before we can prioritise our requirements, there are some things
we need to find out.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The period of time we have to resolve these requirements</em> -
e.g. before the next software release, pivotal demonstration, or other
deadlines requiring their completion. This is known as a
<strong>timebox</strong>. This might be a week or two, but for agile,
this should not be longer than a month. Longer deadlines with more
complex requirements may be split into a number of timeboxes.</li>
<li>
<em>How much overall effort we have available</em> - i.e. who will
be involved and how much of their time we will have during this
period.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need estimates for how long each requirement will take to
resolve, since it’s difficult to meaningfully prioritise requirements
without knowing what the effort tradeoffs will be. Even if we know how
important each requirement is, how would we even know if completing the
project is possible? Or if we do not know how long it will take to
deliver those requirements we deem to be critical to the success of a
project, how can we know if we can include other less important
ones?</p>
<p>It is often not the reality in practice, but estimation should
ideally be done by the people likely to do the actual work: the
developers themselves. It shouldn’t be done by project managers or those
otherwise not involved in development, simply because they are not best
placed to estimate, and those doing the work are the ones who are
effectively committing to these figures. As well as lacking the inherent
technical skills required to estimate, having senior non-development
roles dictating estimates is that they are at risk of non-development
biases such as idealised project timelines and goals which may not be
achievable.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="t-shirt-estimation">T-Shirt Estimation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#t-shirt-estimation"></a>
</h3>
<p>One method typically used in agile for estimation is <em>t-shirt
estimation</em>. Instead of applying specific estimates of time to
complete each requirement or task, you instead assign a t-shirt size to
each in order to estimate their size <em>relative to each other</em>.
T-shirt estimation is a far simpler method that emphasises simplicity,
speed, and collaboration in early stages of a project where details are
often vague.</p>
<p>Some example sizes might be:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead><tr class="header">
<th>Size</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Rough time estimate</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>XS</td>
<td>Very quick and easy</td>
<td>&lt; 1 day</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>S</td>
<td>Small effort</td>
<td>1-2 days</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>M</td>
<td>Medium effort</td>
<td>2-4 days</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>L</td>
<td>Large effort</td>
<td>5-7 days</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>XL</td>
<td>Very large or unclear</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So for any tasks judged to be <code>XL</code>, this implies it needs
to be clarified and/or broken down into further tasks.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Solo Exercise: Apply T-shirt Estimates to your
Product Backlog</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>5 mins.</p>
<p>On your own, quickly apply the t-shirt estimation technique to the
issues in your product backlog, noting down your estimates. Use the
following categories, which have a greatly reduced time scale:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead><tr class="header">
<th>Size</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Rough time estimate</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>XS</td>
<td>Very quick and easy</td>
<td>&lt; 10 mins</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>S</td>
<td>Small effort</td>
<td>10-30 mins</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>M</td>
<td>Medium effort</td>
<td>1-2 hours</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>L</td>
<td>Large effort</td>
<td>2-5 hours</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>XL</td>
<td>Very large or unclear</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>An effective way of helping to make your estimates more accurate is
to do it as a team. Other members can ask prudent questions that may not
have been considered, and bring in other sanity checks and their own
development experience. Just talking things through can help uncover
other complexities and pitfalls, and raise crucial questions to clarify
ambiguities.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Why is it so Difficult to Estimate?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Estimation is a very valuable skill to learn, and one that is often
difficult. Lack of experience in estimation can play a part, but a
number of psychological causes can also contribute. One of these is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" class="external-link">Dunning-Kruger</a>,
a type of cognitive bias in which people tend to overestimate their
abilities, whilst in opposition to this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" class="external-link">imposter
syndrome</a>, where due to a lack of confidence people underestimate
their abilities. The key message here is to be honest about what you can
do, and find out as much information that is reasonably appropriate
before arriving at an estimate.</p>
<p>More experience in estimation will also help to reduce these effects.
So keep estimating!</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid mapping sizes to exact hours/days too early</li>
<li>Focus on relative sizing between stories</li>

<li>Use the discussion to uncover unknowns or assumptions about the
requirements, and clarify them in the product backlog</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>To an extent, the <em>process</em> of deciding estimates is more
important than the actual result of estimation. Creating estimates
forces the team to consider the detail of what will be required to
fulfil a requirement, beyond just coming up with a number. For example,
when coming up with an estimate it may become clear there are unrealised
dependencies between tasks, or some requirements are not readily
estimable due to being too complex or too widely scoped, and require
further decomposition into multiple smaller requirements to estimate
properly. It may also become clear that some requirements may not be
achievable at all within the timeframe of the project!</p>
</div>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="prioritisation">Prioritisation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prioritisation"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now we have our estimates we can decide how important each
requirement is to the success of the project. This should be decided by
the project stakeholders; those - or their representatives - who have a
stake in the success of the project and are either directly affected or
affected by the project, e.g. clients, end-users, collaborators,
etc.</p>
<p>To prioritise these requirements we can use a method called
<strong>MoSCoW</strong>, a way to reach a common understanding with
stakeholders on the importance of successfully delivering each
requirement for a timebox. MoSCoW is an acronym that stands for
<strong>Must have</strong>, <strong>Should have</strong>, <strong>Could
have</strong>, and <strong>Won’t have</strong>. Each requirement is
discussed by the stakeholder group and falls into one of these
categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Must Have</em> (MH) - these requirements are critical to the
current timebox for it to succeed. Even the inability to deliver just
one of these would cause the project to be considered a failure.</li>
<li>
<em>Should Have</em> (SH) - these are important requirements but not
<em>necessary</em> for delivery in the timebox. They may be as
<em>important</em> as Must Haves, but there may be other ways to achieve
them or perhaps they can be held back for a future development
timebox.</li>
<li>
<em>Could Have</em> (CH) - these are desirable but not necessary,
and each of these will be included in this timebox if it can be
achieved.</li>
<li>
<em>Won’t Have</em> (WH) - these are agreed to be out of scope,
perhaps because they are the least important or not critical for this
phase of development.</li>
</ul>
<p>In typical use, the ratio to aim for of requirements to the MH/SH/CH
categories is 60%/20%/20% for a particular timebox. Importantly, the
division is by the requirement <em>estimates</em>, not by number of
requirements, so 60% means 60% of the overall estimated effort for
requirements are Must Haves.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Because it gives you a unique degree of
control of your project for each time period. It awards you 40% of
flexibility with allocating your effort depending on what’s critical and
how things progress. This effectively forces a tradeoff between the
effort available and critical objectives, maintaining a significant
safety margin. The idea is that as a project progresses, even if it
becomes clear that you are only able to deliver the Must Haves for a
particular time period, you have still delivered it
<em>successfully</em>.</p>

</figure><p>One of the most important skills for a software engineer working in
industry is the ability to communicate effectively with clients.</p>
<p>Clear communication builds trust, prevents expensive
misunderstandings, and ensures that the business goals and technical
implementation are aligned.</p>
<p>While this course is focused on software engineering, the points that
we’ll cover can be applied to any project.</p>

<figure><img src="fig/speaking_different_languages.jpg" alt="photo of speach bubbles with words in different languages" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Photo by zhendong wang on Unsplash</div>
</figure><p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You’re in a meeting with a client and
explain, <em>“We’re planning to refactor the backend and upgrade the
framework so we can implement the auth flow asynchronously. That should
make deployments cleaner.”</em> The client nods politely but later
admits they didn’t understand a word. They leave the meeting unclear on
what’s being done, why it’s needed, or how it affects their goals.</p>
<p>This kind of miscommunication is surprisingly common. It stems from
the <strong>Expert Awareness Gap</strong> (also known as the Curse of
Knowledge), a disconnect between experts and non-experts, where the
expert unintentionally assumes that others share their knowledge,
context, or mental models, when they do not. This is because experts
internalise concepts so deeply that they become automatic and invisible
to them. In this context, software engineers may assume non-technical
stakeholders share their understanding of technical concepts that have
become second nature. As a result, clients may feel confused, excluded,
or unsure how to make informed decisions.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/bridge_the_gap.jpg" alt="Lizard jumping across a large gap" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Photo by Denny Luan on Unsplash</div>
</figure><p>To bridge this gap, and build shared understanding, try the following
techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use analogies or plain language.</strong><br>
For example, instead of saying <em>“we’re refactoring the code,”</em>
try <em>“we’re tidying up the code to make it easier and safer to change
in the future.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand acronyms even if they seem obvious.</strong><br>
Don’t assume clients know what CI/CD (Continuous Integration /
Continuous Deployment), API (Application Programming Interface), or JWT
(JSON Web Token) mean. A good rule is to expand any acronym at least the
first time you use it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connect technical changes to client value.</strong><br>
For instance, rather than saying <em>“we’re upgrading the
framework,”</em> say <em>“we’re upgrading the framework to reduce bugs
and give us access to modern features that improve security and
performance.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Frame decisions in terms of the client’s
goals.</strong><br>
When discussing trade-offs, explain how technical choices affect things
like user experience, compliance, or costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use visuals to support understanding.</strong><br>
Diagrams, such as flowcharts, can help convey complex ideas without
relying on jargon.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By learning to speak the client’s language you build their trust,
enable better decision making, and avoid frustration on both sides.</p>

<h2 id="setting-realistic-expectations">Setting Realistic Expectations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setting-realistic-expectations"></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> In a client meeting, a developer says,
<em>“Yes, we should be able to add that feature by the end of the
sprint.”</em> The client is pleased. However, a week later, it becomes
clear that the feature is more complex than expected, other tasks are
behind schedule, and the team now has to explain the delay. The client
feels frustrated and blindsided and this impacts the trust they have in
your development team.</p>
<p>This is a classic example of unrealistic expectations, often caused
by optimism, pressure to please, or fear of disappointing the client in
the moment.</p>
<p>Setting realistic expectations is one of the most important parts of
client communication. It helps prevent misunderstandings, reduces
stress, and builds long-term trust.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/negotiation.jpg" alt="man with laptop gesturing" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Photo by Headway on Unsplash</div>
</figure><ul>
<li><p><strong>Under-promise, over-deliver</strong><br>
Clients would rather be pleasantly surprised than disappointed. Estimate
conservatively, it’s better to deliver something early or with extra
polish than to miss a deadline.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build in contingency time</strong><br>
Always allow for the unexpected. Think carefully about what could go
wrong (technical complexity, team availability, integration issues), and
factor that into your estimates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid committing on the spot</strong><br>
Don’t feel pressured to promise something immediately. It’s entirely
professional to say:<br><em>“Let me check with the team and get back to you this
afternoon.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be honest about trade-offs and limitations</strong><br>
For example:<br><em>“We can deliver this in two weeks, but without automated testing. If
you want it tested properly, we’ll need an extra week.”</em></p></li>

</figure><p><strong>Scope creep</strong>, also known as <em>requirement
creep</em>, happens when new features or changes are added during the
project without adjusting time or budget. If this isn’t managed, it can
derail progress and increase risk.</p>
<p>Help clients make informed decisions by explaining:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Project Management Triangle</strong><br>
You can have two of the following:<br>
Fast, Cheap, or Good - but rarely all three at once.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact of changes</strong><br>
Rather than saying <em>“That’s not possible,”</em> present
options:<br><em>“We can do X by Friday, or Y by next week. What’s more important to
you?”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cost of adding features</strong><br>
Be clear about how additional features may delay delivery, increase
complexity, or reduce testing time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stay neutral and solution-focused</strong><br>
Avoid blame or emotional language. Stick to the facts and guide clients
toward trade-offs based on their priorities.</p></li>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>(10 minutes)</p>
<p>Your team has already agreed with the client on the project’s scope
and timeline. You’re midway through the first sprint when the client
sends an email saying:</p>
<p>“We’ve been thinking, and we’d really like to add a feature that
allows users to share their progress with friends. Can we fit that in
before the demo next week?”</p>
<p>This new feature was not in the original backlog and has design,
development, and testing implications.</p>
<p>Discuss your response to the client, using the principles outlined
above, and then draft a short email that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledges the client’s request positively and
professionally;</li>
<li>Explains the impact of the new feature on timeline, scope and/or

<h3 id="tracking-velocity">Tracking Velocity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tracking-velocity"></a>
</h3>
<p>In this context, velocity describes the amount of work that a team
delivers in a set period.</p>
<p>You would track how many tasks your team has completed in previous
Sprints and use this as a baseline for how many tasks of a similar size
can be completed in the current sprint. This gives you an evidence-based
approach to expectation setting.</p>
<p>Tracking velocity can help you to set realistic timelines based on
what your team has actually delivered in the past. It can also help you
to build trust with the client through transparency and
predictability.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="timeboxing">Timeboxing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#timeboxing"></a>
</h3>
<p>Timeboxing is where you allocate a fixed amount of time to an issue
and stop when that time is up, regardless of whether the issue has been
resolved. Timeboxing can be useful when the work is exploratory or
uncertain because it:</p>
<ul>
<li>makes transparent to the client how much time is being allocated to
learning or discovery, which may not be clear from observable progress
on the product.</li>
<li>helps avoid analysis paralysis (getting stuck on one issue
indefinitely)</li>
<li>controls the risk when the outcome is uncertain</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: <em>“Since we’re not yet sure how complex this
integration is, we’ll allocate 2 days to investigate. We’ll regroup
after that to decide the next steps based on what we learn.”</em></p>
<p>Sprints are a example of timeboxing. You might also timebox a product
backlog item within a Sprint.</p>

<h2 id="discussing-prioritisation">Discussing Prioritisation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#discussing-prioritisation"></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A client approaches your team with a
vision for a meal-planning app. They want grocery shopping integration,
dietary preference tracking, AI-generated recipes, video tutorials, and
a sleek mobile interface, all delivered within eight weeks. You explain
that the scope is too large for the timeline, but the client insists
each feature is essential. Without clear prioritisation, the team
attempts to build everything and ends up delivering an unstable app that
fails to meet user expectations. The client is disappointed, and trust
is damaged.</p>
<p>This kind of situation is common. Clients are often enthusiastic and
ambitious, but may not understand the trade-offs involved. That’s why
<strong>clear prioritisation discussions</strong> are essential.</p>

<h3 id="why-prioritisation-matters">Why Prioritisation Matters<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-prioritisation-matters"></a>
</h3>
<p>There’s rarely enough time or budget to build every requested
feature. Prioritisation helps focus resources on what truly matters,
ensuring that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The product can launch on time.</li>
<li>Key user needs are met early.</li>
<li>The team can iterate and improve based on real feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Introducing the concept of the <strong>Minimum Viable Product
(MVP)</strong> can help clients shift from “everything now” to “what’s
essential first.”</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-mvp-a-strategic-starting-point">The MVP: A Strategic Starting Point<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-mvp-a-strategic-starting-point"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <strong>MVP</strong> is a basic, working version of the product
that delivers the product’s core value. It’s not the final product, but
it’s enough to test with users and validate the idea.</p>
<p>For instance, imagine that the client wants you to build a car. The
core value is a structure with wheels that can get you from A to B, so
the MVP might be a skateboard.</p>

<p>Use the <strong>MoSCoW method</strong> to help clients classify
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Must haves</strong> – Essential for the product to
function.</li>
<li>
<strong>Should haves</strong> – Important, but not critical for
launch.</li>
<li>
<strong>Could haves</strong> – Desirable extras, only if time
allows.</li>
<li>
<strong>Won’t haves (for now)</strong> – Deferred until a later
phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework encourages honest, collaborative conversations about
what really matters, and helps avoid overcommitting.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="facilitating-prioritisation">Facilitating Prioritisation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#facilitating-prioritisation"></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use visuals (roadmaps, feature lists) to support the
discussion.</li>
<li>Frame prioritisation in terms of client goals: <em>“Which features
will help you learn the most from your first users?”</em>
</li>
<li>Be prepared to explain technical dependencies (e.g. why Feature A
must come before Feature B).</li>
<li>Remind clients that starting small doesn’t mean thinking small - a
more complex product can be built on top of the MVP but only when the
bare essentials are in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>By leading productive prioritisation conversations, you help clients
make better decisions, reduce risk, and increase the likelihood of a
successful product launch.</p>

unhappy. By “modern,” they actually meant visually similar to Apple’s

fewer clicks to reach key information?”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probe when clients say, “use your
judgement”</strong><br>
If the client doesn’t know exactly what they want, try asking:<br><em>“What don’t you want?”</em> or<br><em>“Can you show me an example of something you like or something you
don’t like?”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summarise and confirm</strong><br>
Restate what you’ve heard to confirm your understanding.<br>
Example:<br><em>“So just to confirm, you’d like the dashboard to show data from the

<li><p><strong>Document everything clearly</strong><br>
Use written follow-ups like email recaps or meeting notes to reinforce
shared understanding. These also create a useful reference

<p>The three key objectives of a kickoff meeting are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Agree prioritised requirements</strong>: Work with the
client to review and prioritise the product backlog. While the final
decision rests with the client, prioritisation should be a two-way
conversation. Developers should feel confident advocating for items they
believe are critical, especially technical tasks that may not appear
important to non-technical stakeholders but are essential for enabling
future features or maintaining system stability.</li>
<li>
<strong>Set expectations</strong>: Establish a shared understanding
of what will be delivered, when, and to what standard. This includes
clarifying timelines, defining the scope of work for early iterations
(such as the MVP), and agreeing on communication channels and response
times. Setting clear expectations upfront helps reduce misunderstandings
and prevents scope creep later in the project.</li>
<li>
<strong>Resolve ambiguity</strong>: Clarify any unclear or vague
requirements before development begins. This may involve asking the
client to define specific terms, provide examples, or explain business
rules in detail. The goal is to remove guesswork and ensure that both
the development team and the client share the same understanding of what
is being built and why.</li>

</figure><p>In a client meeting, the software development team (the supplier)
should take responsibility for leading the meeting. As an analogy, when
an electrician comes to your house, they don’t expect you to explain
wiring protocols, instead they ask questions to diagnose the problem and
recommend solutions. Similarly, the development team should guide the
meeting to get the clarity they need to do their job.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nominate one person to chair the meeting, it’s their job to ensure
that the meeting stays on track and follows the agenda. The rest of the
group can add questions or comments but it’s more straightforward if
there is a single person leading the meeting.</li>
<li>Make sure you get the information you need from the meeting. Don’t
assume that the client will volunteer all necessary information - you
may need to draw it out of them through asking lots of questions.</li>
<li>Clients often don’t know what’s important to developers. They may
focus on the appearance of the product or general ideas rather than
technical details. It’s your job to lead the discussion towards finding
the details you need. You could use diagrams, examples, or “what-if”
scenarios to help clients think through their needs.</li>

<h2 id="meeting-notes">Meeting Notes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#meeting-notes"></a>
</h2>
<p>Meeting notes are a vital output from any client meeting. They
protect against miscommunication, enable follow-up, and support future
planning.</p>
<p>Meeting notes should capture:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Decisions</strong>: What was agreed in the meeting.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ambiguity</strong>: Any areas that are still unclear and/or
any open questions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Actions</strong>: Who is doing what and by when. Include
actions on the software development team and on the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s helpful to take notes in a shared document (e.g., google doc)
that everyone can access. This way, if any updates are made, everyone
can see them straight away.</p>
<p>Send a summary email containing the meeting notes within 24 hours of
the meeting to confirm that everyone is on the same page.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to use consistent formating across meetings for
clarity (e.g., bullet points or a table).</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In a software development project the infrastructure - particularly
the version control system - should be configured and used in way that
reflects and support the team’s chosen development process. This
alignment ensures that the tools in place reinforce the way the team
works, rather than creating friction or bottlenecks. With a team
following an agile, feature-driven workflow, the version control system
should explicitly support that workflow.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as development processes evolve, the infrastructure
should evolve with them. A version control system that reflects the
development process helps to reduce coding errors, increases
communications between members, streamline the collaborative process,
and improves the overall efficiency and quality of the software being
produced.</p>
<p>In the next couple of episodes, we’ll look at how to use
well-established practices for using version control, using Git and
GitHub as an example, to illustrate how it can support software
developed using an agile approach.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Solo Exercise: Set up SSH Keypair for use with
GitHub</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>5 mins.</p>
<p>In order to access GitHub using Git from your machine securely, you
need to set up a way of authenticating yourself with GitHub through Git.
The recommended way to do that for this course is to set up <a href="https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication" class="external-link"><em>SSH
authentication</em></a> - a method of authentication that is more secure
than sending <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/110415/is-it-ok-to-send-plain-text-password-over-https" class="external-link"><em>passwords
over HTTPS</em></a> and which requires a pair of keys - one public that
you upload to your GitHub account, and one private that remains on your
machine.</p>
<p>GitHub provides full documentation and guides on how to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent" class="external-link">Generate
an SSH key</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account" class="external-link">Add
an SSH key to a GitHub account</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To generate an SSH key pair, you will need to run the
<code>ssh-keygen</code> command from your command line tool/GitBash and
provide <strong>your identity for the key pair</strong> (e.g. the email
address you used to register with GitHub) via the <code>-C</code>
parameter as shown below. Note that the <code>ssh-keygen</code> command
can be run with different parameters - e.g. to select a specific public
key algorithm and key length; if you do not use them
<code>ssh-keygen</code> will generate an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#:~:text=RSA%20involves%20a%20public%20key,by%20using%20the%20private%20key." class="external-link">RSA</a>
key pair for you by default. GitHub now recommends that you use a newer
cryptographic standard (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA" class="external-link">EdDSA</a> variant algorithm
<a href="https://cryptobook.nakov.com/digital-signatures/eddsa-and-ed25519" class="external-link">Ed25519</a>),
so please be sure to specify it using the <code>-t</code> flag as shown
below. It will also prompt you to answer a few questions - e.g. where to
save the keys on your machine and a passphrase to use to protect your
private key. Pressing ‘Enter’ on these prompts will get
<code>ssh-keygen</code> to use the default key location (within
<code>.ssh</code> folder in your home directory) and set the passphrase
to empty.</p>

<p>Next, you need to copy your public key (<strong>not your private key

can get its contents (e.g. on a Mac OS system) as follows:</p>

</div>
<p>Copy the line of output that starts with “ssh-ed25519” and ends with
your email address (it may start with a different algorithm name based
on which one you used to generate the key pair and it may have gone over

that contains the private key counterpart), paste the public key from
your clipboard into the box labelled “Key” (making sure it does not
contain any line breaks), then click the “Add SSH key” button.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>You might be used to committing code directly, but not sure what
branches really are or why they matter? When you start a new Git
repository and begin committing, all changes go into a branch — by
default, this is usually called <code>main</code> (or
<code>master</code> in older repositories). The name “main” is just a
convention — a Git repository’s default branch can technically be named
anything.</p>
<p>So why not just always use the main branch? While it is possible to
always commit to <code>main</code>, it is not ideal when you’re
collaborating with others, or when you are working on new features or
want to experiment with your code and you want to keep main clean and
stable for your users and collaborators.</p>
<p>Creating and working on a separate branch, often called a “feature”
branch, allows developers to “branch off” development from a particular
commit in the repository, enabling them to make changes (as new commits)
to a branch without disrupting the <code>main</code> branch. When this
separate development has been tested and is judged to be ready, the
commits on this branch are then merged into the <code>main</code>
branch.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/collab-workflow-branches-merging.png" alt="Diagram depicting a feature branch being created off of a main branch, with its own commits, and those commits then being merged onto the main branch." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>You should consider starting a new branch whenever you are working on

<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It enables the main branch to remain stable while you and the team
explore and test the new code on a feature branch</li>
<li>It enables you to keep the untested and not-yet-functional feature
branch code under version control and backed up</li>
<li>You and other team members may work on several features at the same
time independently from one another</li>
<li>If you decide that the feature is not working or is no longer needed
- you can easily and safely discard that branch without affecting the
rest of the code</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires that the team understand this approach and how to use it in
an agreed and consistent manner</li>
<li>May become complicated if you need to use features available on
another branch in your own branch</li>
<li>Similarly, if <code>main</code> contains many changes not in feature
branches, it may diverge considerably from these feature branches</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>When you are ready to bring the changes from your feature branch back
into the main branch, Git offers you to do a merge - a process that
unifies work done in 2 separate branches. Git will take two (or more -
you can merge more branches at the same time) commit pointers and
attempt to find a common base commit between them. Git has several
different methods of finding the base commit - these methods are called
“merge strategies”. Once Git finds the common base commit it will create
a new “merge commit” that combines the changes of the specified merge
commits. Technically, a merge commit is a regular commit which just
happens to have two parent commits.</p>
<p>Each merge strategy is suited for a different scenario. The choice of
strategy depends on the complexity of changes and the desired outcome.
Let’s have a look at the most commonly used merge strategies.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="fast-forward-merge">Fast Forward Merge<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fast-forward-merge"></a>
</h3>
<p>A fast-forward merge occurs when the main branch has not diverged
from the feature branch, meaning there are no new commits on the main
branch since the feature branch was created.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>A - B - C [main]
         \
          D - E [feature]</code></pre>
<p>In this case, Git simply moves the main branch pointer to the latest
commit in the feature branch. This strategy is simple and keeps the
commit history linear - i.e. the history is one straight line.</p>
<p>After a fast forward merge:</p>
<pre class="text"><code><span><span class="va">A</span> <span class="op">-</span> <span class="va">B</span> <span class="op">-</span> <span class="va">C</span> <span class="op">-</span> <span class="va">D</span> <span class="op">-</span> <span class="va">E</span> <span class="op">[</span><span class="va">main</span><span class="op">]</span><span class="op">[</span><span class="va">feature</span><span class="op">]</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Fast forward merge strategy is best used when you have a short-lived
feature branch that needs to be merged back into the main branch, and no
other changes have been made to the main branch in the meantime.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="way-merge-with-merge-commit">3-Way Merge with Merge Commit<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#way-merge-with-merge-commit"></a>
</h3>
<p>A fast-forward merge is not possible if the main and the feature
branches have diverged.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>A - B - C - F [main]
         \
          D - E [feature]</code></pre>
<p>If you try to merge your feature branch changes into the main branch
and other changes have been made to main - regardless of whether these
changes create a conflict or not - Git will try to do a 3-way merge and
generate a merge commit.</p>
<p>A merge commit is a dedicated special commit that records the
combined changes from both branches and has two parent commits,
preserving the history of both lines of development. The name “3-way
merge” comes from the fact that Git uses three commits to generate the
merge commit - the two branch tips and their common ancestor to
reconstruct the changes that are to be merged.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>A - B - C - F - "MergeCommitG" [main]
         \     /
          D - E [feature]</code></pre>
<p>In addition, if the two branches you are trying to merge both changed
the same part of the same file, Git will not be able to figure out which
version to use and merge automatically. When such a situation occurs, it
stops right before the merge commit so that you can resolve the
conflicts manually before continuing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="rebase-merge">Rebase &amp; Merge<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rebase-merge"></a>
</h3>
<p>In Git, there is another way to integrate changes from one branch
into another: the rebase.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to an earlier example from the 3-way merge, where main
and feature branches have diverged with subsequent commits made on each
(so fast-forward merging strategy is not an option).</p>
<pre class="text"><code>A - B - C - F [main]
         \
          D - E [feature]</code></pre>
<p>When you rebase the feature branch with the main branch, Git replays
each commit from the feature branch on top of all the commits from the
main branch in order. This results in a cleaner, linear history that
looks as if the feature branch was started from the latest commit on
main.</p>
<p>So, all the changes introduced on feature branch (commits D and E)
are reapplied on top of commit F - becoming D’ and E’. Note that D’ and
E’ are rebased commits, which are actually new commits with different
SHAs but the same modifications as commits D and E.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>A - B - C - F - D' - E' [main]
             \
              D - E [feature]</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you can go back to the main branch and do a
fast-forward merge with feature branch.</p>
<p>Rebase is ideal for feature branches that have fallen behind the main
development line and need updating. It is particularly useful before
merging long-running feature branches to ensure they apply cleanly on
top of the main branch. Rebasing maintains a linear history and avoids
merge commits (like fast forwarding), making it look as if changes were
made sequentially and as if you created your feature branch from a
different point in the repository’s history. A disadvantage is that it
rewrites commit history, which can be problematic for shared branches as
it requires force pushing.</p>

<div id="the-golden-rule-of-rebasing" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">The Golden Rule of Rebasing</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Note that you can also do rebasing with branches on the command line.
But a word of warning: when doing this, be sure you know what will
happen.</p>
<p>Rebasing in this way rewrites the repository’s history, and
therefore, with rebasing, there is a GOLDEN RULE which states that you
should only rebase with a local branch, never a public (shared) branch
you suspect is being used by others. When rebasing, you’re re-writing
the history of commits, so if someone else has the repository on their
own machine and has worked on a particular branch, if you rebase on that
branch, the history will have changed, and they will run into
difficulties when pushing their changes due to the rewritten history. It
can get quite messy, so if in doubt, do a standard merge!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="squash-merge">Squash &amp; Merge<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#squash-merge"></a>
</h3>
<p>Squash and merge squashes all the commits from a feature branch into
a single commit before merging into the main branch. This strategy
simplifies the commit history, making it easier to follow. This strategy
is ideal for merging feature branches with numerous small commits,
resulting in a cleaner main branch history.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>A - B - C - F - "SquashCommitG" [main]
         \
          D - E [feature]</code></pre>
<p>Note that unlike the 3-way merge, <code>SquashCommitG</code> only has
one parent, <code>F</code>, so does not preserve the link to the commits
on the feature branch upon which <code>SquashCommitG</code> is based.
This has caused some to consider squash commits harmful, since that part
of the commit history is lost. For this reason, squash commits are handy
when you want to clean up a commit history from a short-lived feature
branch prior to merging to <code>main</code>, but problematic with
longer lived branches or when maintaining commit history is
important.</p>
<p>FIXME: verify squash commit has only 1 parent when using a
squash-merged PR</p>

that leads to inconsistency across the codebase</li>

<p>So far we’ve looked at different ways we can work on separate strands
of development in branches and then merge them. Since they are
independent, it’s sometimes difficult to know what the overall effect
will be when they are finally merged.</p>
<p>Software development thrives on collaboration, even when much of the
coding is done individually. Getting input from others can have a big
impact on the quality, maintainability, and effectiveness of your work,
often requiring only a small investment of time. Since there is rarely a
single “perfect” way to solve a problem, working with others allows you
to share knowledge, skills, and perspectives, leading to better
solutions and new insights. Through collaboration, you can learn new
techniques, discover tools and infrastructure that streamline
development, and help build a shared understanding that benefits the
wider team or community.</p>
<p>In this episode we’ll look at bringing together the use of feature
branches and code review into a well-established collaborative
development approach called <em>feature branch workflow</em> that aims
to realise these benefits.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="introduction-to-code-review">Introduction to Code Review<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction-to-code-review"></a>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="types-of-code-review">Types of Code Review<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-code-review"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are several types of code review, each suited to different
contexts and goals.</p>
<p>An <em>informal review</em> involves casually asking a colleague for
input or advice. This type of review is often used to improve
understanding, share skills, or get help with problem-solving, rather
than enforce specific standards. Some examples include over-the-shoulder
code review (when one developer talks the other developer through the
code changes while sitting at the same machine), and pair programming
(when two developers work on the code at the same time with one of them
actively coding and the other providing real-time feedback).</p>
<p>A <em>contribution-oriented review</em> occurs when changes or
additions to a codebase are reviewed as they happen - commonly used in
version-controlled software development workflows like GitHub’s pull
requests which we’ll look at in this episode. This approach is a bit
more formal (e.g. structured pull requests with approval workflows) and
tool-assisted, and focuses on ensuring understanding, clarity,
maintainability, and code quality.</p>
<p>Taken to the extreme, a more rigorous method is a <em>formal code
review</em>, such as a Fagan inspection, where a team examines a
codebase, or parts of it, systematically, following strict criteria to
identify defects or ensure conformance to standards. While this method
can be highly effective, it is resource-intensive and a less common
practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="code-review-practices-processes">Code Review Practices &amp; Processes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-review-practices-processes"></a>
</h3>
<p>In this episode, we will focus on code review practices centered
around code modifications and contributions. The aim is to integrate
code review into the research software development process in a way that
is lightweight, low-stakes, and easy to adopt. Even a short initial code
review can have a significant impact. As highlighted in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Best-Kept-Secrets-Peer-Review/dp/1599160676" class="external-link">“Best
Kept Secrets of Peer Code Review” by Jason Cohen</a>, the first hour of
review is the most critical and productive, with diminishing returns
thereafter.</p>
<p>The goal is to strike a practical balance: invest enough time to
offer useful, actionable feedback without turning reviews into a
bottleneck. When reviewing code, focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code quality - is the code clear and readable? Do functions serve a
single purpose? Is it well-structured and consistent with the rest of
the project?</li>
<li>Best practices and conventions - is the project’s coding style
followed? Are tests and documentation included and up to date?</li>
<li>Efficiency and minimalism - does the change duplicate existing
functionality (found elsewhere in the code or in a third-party library)?
Is it limited to what’s required by the issue or ticket?</li>
<li>Knowledge sharing: ask clarifying questions (do not assume you
understand everything or know best) and offer respectful, specific
feedback. This helps everyone learn and builds team trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the value of that first hour, keep your efforts targeted. Do
not spend time on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linting or style issues - automated tools or CI pipelines should
catch these</li>
<li>Hunting for bugs, unless something clearly looks wrong — instead,
check that tests exist for various cases that should catch bugs</li>
<li>Fixing unrelated legacy issues that pre-date the change — log those
separately to avoid scope creep</li>
<li>Architectural overhauls — save big-picture changes for design
discussions or dedicated meetings to decide whether the code needs to be
restructured</li>
<li>Refactoring everything — provide only a few critical suggestions and
aim for incremental improvement, not perfection.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process is typically <em>iterative</em>, with reviewers and
contributors engaging in a cycle of discussion, updates, and re-review
to address questions and refine changes before integration. If a
conversation is taking place in a code review that has not been resolved
by one or two back-and-forth exchange, then consider scheduling a
conversation, or a pair programming session to discuss things further
(and record the outcome of the discussion - e.g. in the pull requests’s
comments).</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In our previous exercise we focused on writing code in an individual
setting on feature branches. However if we allowed everyone to develop
and merge code whenever, wherever, and however they wanted, without any
kind of coordination, the result would likely be a chaotic and
potentially non-functional mess. Using feature branches helps to some
extent, keeping strands of development separate but in many cases, when
it comes time to merge our branch into the <code>main</code> branch, it
would be really useful to have a way to <em>review</em> code before it’s
finally merged to verify that these changes are well considered and
implemented.</p>
<p>Fortunately version control hosting infrastructures like GitHub
support an additional step in the use of feature branches, the <em>pull
request</em>: the changes in a feature branch are proposed in a pull
request, and then the pull request is reviewed by another team member
(or maybe several). If the pull request is judged to be a suitable set
of changes, the pull request is accepted and the changes are merged
using a branch merging strategy as discussed.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/collab-workflow-pull-request.png" alt="Diagram depicting a feature branch being created off of a main branch, with its own commits, and those commits then being merged onto the main branch." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>However, if the review identifies issues that indicate that it is
unsuitable to be merged, the pull request is rejected. This does not
necessarily mean the pull request has to be closed. Development on the
feature branch of that pull request may continue, with further commits
to address the points brought up in the review, and then the pull
request reviewed again at a later time and perhaps accepted and
merged.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/collab-workflow-pr-second-review.png" alt="Diagram depicting a failed first review of a pull request, subsequent fixes to address the review, and a successful second review and merge to main." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>In a sense, a pull request is a verification check - or insurance
policy - against merging bad commits to the <code>main</code>
branch.</p>

<p>Let’s each create a pull request now, based on our changes.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>First, go the <code>Pull requests</code> tab at the top of the group
repository main page, and select <code>New pull request</code>
</li>
<li>In the <code>Compare changes</code> page that comes up: <img src="fig/collab-workflow-coffee-create-pr.png" alt="Comparing changes between feature and main branches to create a pull request, showing the commits to merge and the line-by-line changes between files" class="figure"><ul>
<li>Select <code>compare:</code> and select your new branch,
e.g. <code>123-readme-description</code> You should now see a summary of
the changes between the new branch and the <code>main</code> branch,
i.e. a single commit and the new README content you pushed earlier</li>
<li>Select <code>Create pull request</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the <code>Open a pull request</code> page that appears: <img src="fig/collab-workflow-coffee-create-pr2.png" alt="Add details for pull request before creating it, including a reviewer, label, title, and description" class="figure"><ul>
<li>Enter a fitting title, brief description, and label</li>
<li>Select <code>Reviewers</code> and add the GitHub account for the
other group member who will review your pull request</li>
<li>Select <code>Create pull request</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll then see a summary of the pull request, including a summary of
any conflicts with the base (<code>main</code>) branch, of which there
should be none. There’s also an option to merge the pull request - but
don’t do this yet, since you’ll need to wait for your pull request to be
reviewed!</p>
<p>Interestingly, even though we have created this PR to do a merge, we
could continue developing our code on this new branch indefinitely if we
wanted. We could make and push new commits to this branch, which would
show up here, and we then merge at a future date. This may be
particularly useful if we need to have a longer discussion about the PR
as it is developing. The discussion would be captured in the comments
for the PR, and when ready, we then merge the PR.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">How Long should PRs be Open?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Which raises the question, of how long should PRs be open, or
branches for that matter? To some degree, this depends on the nature of
the changes being made But branches in Git are designed, and should be
wherever possible, short-lived and deleted when no longer required. The
longer a branch is open, the more potential changes could be made to the
main branch. Then when it comes time to merge the branch, we may get a
lot of conflicts we need to manage. So generally, it’s a good idea to
keep your branches open for a day or two, a few days maximum, before
creating a PR and doing a merge if you can. Note that we can also see
this PR, as well as any others, by selecting the
<code>Pull request</code> tab.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to the <code>Pull requests</code> page on the group
repository</li>
<li>Select the pull request from the other member who you’ve been
assigned to review</li>

separate tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Conversation</code> - an overview of the PR, including
comments and other activities associated with the PR, as well as a
summary at the end, indicating the overall status in terms of reviews
requested, and whether there are any merge conflicts with the base
branch (<code>main</code> in this case)</li>
<li>
<code>Commits</code> - a list of all commits on the feature branch
that have yet to be merged into the base branch</li>
<li>
<code>Checks</code> - whether there are any automated checks
implemented in GitHub Actions and their status</li>
<li>
<code>Files changed</code> - the list of files and their
line-by-line changes for this PR</li>
</ul>
<p>If you select the <code>Files changed</code> tab, of if you select
<code>Add your review</code> from the <code>Conversation</code> page
which takes you to the same tab, you can then begin your review.</p>
<p>By default, the presented view indicates a “unified” view.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/collab-workflow-pr-review-unified.png" alt="Unified view of file changes for a pull request" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>This shows deletions highlighted in red, and additions highlighted in
green.</p>
<p>Another view is the “split” view of these changes, which is
selectable by clicking on the cog-like icon and selecting
<code>Split</code>:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/collab-workflow-pr-review-split.png" alt="Split view of file changes for a pull request" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>This provides a side-by-side alternative, with the older version on
the left, and the newer version on the right. In this case, you should
see a number of green highlighted lines on the right side of this view,
indicating the added lines.</p>
<p>When providing a review, we have the option of adding comments or
suggestions inline to the proposed changes. By hovering over a line and
selecting the ‘+’ symbol at the start of the line, we’re able to add a
comment on that line, for example if we spotted a spelling or
grammatical mistake, or in the case of code, a programmatic problem or
other issue.</p>

<p>Testing is a critical part of writing reliable, maintainable code —
especially in collaborative or research environments where
reproducibility and correctness are key.</p>
<p>In this session, we will explore why testing matters, and introduce
different levels of testing — from small, focused unit tests, to broader
integration and system tests that check how components work together. We
will also look at testing approaches such as regression testing (to
ensure changes do not break existing behavior) and property-based
testing (to test a wide range of inputs automatically). Finally, we will
cover mocking, a technique used to isolate code during tests by
simulating the behavior of external dependencies.</p>

<p>Code testing is the process of verifying that your code behaves as
expected and continues to do so as it evolves. It helps catch bugs
early, ensures changes do not unintentionally break existing
functionality, and supports the development of more robust and
maintainable software. Whether you’re working on a small script or a
large application, incorporating testing into your workflow builds
confidence in your code and makes collaboration and future updates much
easier.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="why-test-your-code">Why test your code?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-test-your-code"></a>
</h3>
<p>Being able to demonstrate that a process generates the right results
is important in any field of research, whether it is software generating
those results or not. So when writing software we need to ask ourselves
some key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the code we develop works as expected?</li>
<li>To what extent are we confident of the accuracy of results that
software produces?</li>
<li>Can we and others verify these assertions for themselves?</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are unable to demonstrate that our software fulfills these
criteria, why would anyone use it?</p>
<p>As a codebase grows, debugging becomes more challenging, and new code
may introduce bugs or unexpected behavior in parts of the system it does
not directly interact with. Tests can help catch issues before they
become runtime bugs, and a failing test can pinpoint the source of the
problem. Additionally, tests serve as invocation examples for other
developers and users, making it easier for them to reuse the code
effectively.</p>
<p>Having well-defined tests for our software helps ensure your software
works correctly, reliably, and consistently over time. By identifying
bugs early and confirming that new changes do not break existing
functionality, testing improves code quality, reduces the risk of errors
in production, and makes future development and long-term maintenance
faster and safer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="types-of-testing---levels">Types of Testing - Levels<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-testing---levels"></a>
</h3>
<p>Testing can be performed at different code levels, each serving a
distinct purpose to ensure software behaves correctly at various stages
of execution. Together, these testing levels provide a structured
approach to improving software quality and reliability.</p>
<p><em>Unit testing</em> is the most granular level, where individual
components—like functions or classes—are tested in isolation to confirm
they behave correctly under a variety of inputs. This makes it easier to
identify and fix bugs early in the development process.</p>
<p><em>Integration testing</em> builds on unit testing by checking how
multiple components or modules work together. This level of testing
helps catch issues that arise when components interact — such as
unexpected data formats, interface mismatches, or dependency
problems.</p>
<p>At the highest level, system testing evaluates the software as a
complete, integrated system. This type of testing focuses on validating
the entire application’s functionality from end to end, typically from
the user’s perspective, including inputs, outputs, and how the system
behaves under various conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="types-of-testing---approaches">Types of Testing - Approaches<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#types-of-testing---approaches"></a>
</h3>
<p>Different approaches to code testing help ensure that software
behaves as expected under a range of conditions. When the expected
output of a function or program is known, tests can directly check that
the results match fixed values or fall within a defined confidence
interval.</p>
<p>However, for cases where exact outputs are not predictable — such as
simulations with random elements — <em>property-based testing</em> is
useful. This method tests a wide range of inputs to ensure that certain
properties or patterns hold true across them.</p>
<p>Another important approach is <em>regression testing</em>, which
helps detect when previously working functionality breaks due to recent
changes in the code. By rerunning earlier tests, developers can catch
and address these regressions early, maintaining software stability over
time.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="mocking">Mocking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mocking"></a>
</h4>
<p>When running tests, you often want to focus on testing a specific
piece of functionality, but dependencies on external objects or
functions can complicate this, as you cannot always be sure they work as
expected. Mocking addresses this by allowing you to replace those
dependencies with “mocked” objects or functions that behave according to
your instructions. So, <em>mocking</em> is a testing approach used to
isolate the unit of code being tested by replacing its dependencies with
simplified, controllable versions — known as <em>mocks</em>.</p>
<p>Mocks mimic the behavior of real components (such as databases, APIs,
or external services) without requiring their full functionality or
availability. This allows developers to test specific code paths,
simulate error conditions, or verify how a unit interacts with other
parts of the system. Mocking is especially useful in unit and
integration testing to ensure tests remain focused, fast and
reliable.</p>
<p>For example, if a function modifies data and writes it to a file, you
can mock the file-writing object, so instead of creating an actual file,
the mocked object stores the “written” data. This enables you to verify
that the data written is as expected, without actually creating a file,
making tests more controlled and efficient.</p>

<p>For this lesson we’ll need to create a new GitHub repository based on
the contents of another repository.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

on a Mac). Then, on the command line, navigate to where you’d like the

<p>Next, let’s take a look at the code, which is in the
<code>industry-skills-testing/mymath directory</code>, called
<code>factorial.py</code>, so open this file in an editor.</p>
<p>The example code is a basic Python implementation of Factorial.
Essentially, it multiplies all the whole numbers from a given number
down to 1 e.g. given 3, that’s 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 - so the factorial of 3 is
6.</p>

<p>Then at the prompt, import the <code>factorial</code> function from
the <code>mymath</code> library and run it:</p>

</div>
<p>Which gives us 6 - which gives us some evidence that this function is
working. Of course, in practice, our functions may well be more
complicated than this, and of course, they may call other separate
functions. Now we could just come up with a list of known input numbers
and expected outputs and run each of these manually to test the code,
but this would take some time. Computers are really good at one thing -
automation - so let’s use that and automate our tests, to make it easy
for ourselves.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>So how do we run these tests? Well, we need to install a Python
package called <code>pytest</code>, since the unit tests have been
written using it. Typically, we’d use a virtual environment for
this.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">What Are Virtual Environments?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Virtual environments are an indispensible tool for managing package
dependencies across multiple projects, and could be a whole topic
itself. In the case of Python, the idea is that instead of installing
Python packages at the level of our machine’s Python installation, we’re
going to install them within their own “container”, which is separate to
the machine’s Python installation. Then we’ll run our Python code only
using packages within that virtual environment.</p>
<p>There are a number of key benefits to using virtual environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>It creates a clear separation between the packages we use for this
project, and the packages we use other projects.</li>
<li>We don’t end up with a machine’s Python installation containing a
clutter of a thousand different packages, where determining which
packages are used for which project often becomes very time consuming
and prone to error.</li>
<li>Since we are sure what our code actually needs as dependencies, it
becomes much easier for someone else (which could be a future version of
ourselves) to know what these dependencies are and install them to use
our code.</li>
<li>Virtual environments are not limited to Python; for example there
are similar tools for available for Ruby, Java and JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So in summary, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new virtual environment to hold Python packages</li>
<li>Activate that new virtual environment</li>
<li>Install <code>pytest</code> into our new virtual environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, we using a Python unit test framework called
<code>pytest</code>. There are other such frameworks for Python,
including <code>unittest</code> (which is built-in to Python) and
<code>nose</code>, but <code>pytest</code> is regarded as the most
popular.</p>
<p>In this example, we have a single unit test, which we’ve called
<code>test_3</code>. Within that test method, we are essentially doing
what we did when we ran it manually earlier: we’re running factorial
with the argument 3, and checking it equals 6. We use a Python
<code>assert</code> statement to verify the two are the same, and if
not, the test will fail.</p>
<p>So how do we run this test? In the shell, we can run this test by
ensuring we’re in the repository’s root directory, and running:</p>

<p>So what happens? The single dot next to the test script filename
means the single test we have was successfully run, so our test
passes!</p>
<p>But how does unittest know what to run exactly? Unit test frameworks
like <code>pytest</code> follow a common pattern of finding tests and
running them. When we give a single file argument to
<code>pytest</code>, it searches the Python file functions starting with
<code>test_</code>, and runs them. So we could add more tests to this
file in the same way, and it would run each of these tests in turn.</p>

<p>We can see the tests pass. So the really useful thing here, is we can
rapidly add tests and rerun all of them. Particularly with more complex
codes that are harder to reason about, we can develop a set of tests
into a suite of tests to verify the codes’ correctness. Then, whenever
we make changes to our code, we can rerun our tests to make sure we
haven’t broken anything. An additional benefit is that successfully
running our unit tests can also give others confidence that our code
works as expected.</p>

<p>Let’s illustrate another key advantage of having unit tests. Let’s
assume during development we find an error in our code. For example, if
we run our code with <code>-1</code>:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb4">

<p>We get a nonsensical answer of 1, since for negative numbers,
factorial is undefined. So this isn’t desired behaviour!</p>

<h3 id="implementing-a-fix">Implementing a Fix<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#implementing-a-fix"></a>

<p>Therefore, in our implementation we explicitly don’t want to process
negative numbers, so we can add what is known as a <em>precondition</em>
beforehand, and this approach to checking function input data prior to
processing it is considered good practice.</p>
<p>Let’s add the following after the function’s docstring in
<code>mymath/factorial.py</code>, and before
<code>factorial = 1</code>:</p>

<p>But since we’ve amended our code to correct for a known issue, what
would be helpful would be to have a test that checks for the existence
of this issue. This would verify that the fix is behaving correctly, and
also would be a check to ensure the behaviour of the code has not
<em>regressed</em> to a previous bad state. These types of test, which
we introduced briefly before, are known as <em>regression
tests</em>.</p>
<p>But how do we write a regression test for this as a unit test, since
this is an exception, and not a value? Fortunately, unit test frameworks
have ways to check for this.</p>
<p>Let’s add a new test to <code>tests/test_factorial.py</code>:</p>

<p>So here, we use <code>pytest</code>’s built-in <code>raises()</code>

Python’s <code>with</code> here to test for this within the call to

<h3 class="callout-title">What makes a Good Test?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Of course, we only have 3 tests so far, and it would be good to have
more But what kind of tests are good to write? With more tests that
sufficiently test our code, the more confidence we have that our code is
correct. We could keep writing tests for e.g., 10, 15, 20, and so on.
But these become increasingly less useful, since they’re in much the
same “space”. We can’t test all positive numbers, and it’s fair to say
at a certain point, these types of low integers are sufficiently tested.
So what test cases should we choose?</p>
<p>We should select test cases that test two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The paths through our code, so we can check they work as we expect.
For example, if we had a number of paths through the code dictated with
if statements, we write tests to ensure those are followed.</li>
<li>We also need to test the boundaries of the input data we expect to
use, known as <em>edge cases</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if we go back to our code. we can see that there are
some interesting edge cases to test for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero?</li>
<li>Very large numbers (as we’ve already seen)?</li>
<li>Strings?</li>
</ul>
<p>All good candidates for further tests, since they test the code in
different ways, and test different paths through the code.</p>

<p>Doing tasks manually can be time-consuming, error-prone, and hard to

automation allows computers to handle repetitive, structured tasks
reliably, quickly, and consistently, freeing up your time for more
valuable and creative work.</p>
<p>By automating these actions, you save time, reduce the chance of
human error, and ensure that processes are reproducible and consistent.
Automation also provides a clear, documented way to understand how
things are run, making it easier for others to replicate or build upon
your work.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Building on the concept of automation, Continuous Integration (CI) is
the practice of regularly integrating code changes into a shared code
repository and automatically running tasks and key checks each time this
happens (e.g. when changes are merged from development or feature branch
into main, or even after each commit). This helps maintain code quality
and ensures new contributions do not break existing functionality.</p>
<p>A variety of CI services and tools, like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI,
or Jenkins, make it easy to set up automated workflows triggered by code
changes.</p>
<p>CI can also be extended into Continuous Delivery (CD), which
automates the release or deployment of code to production or staging
environments.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="principles-of-ci">Principles of CI<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#principles-of-ci"></a>
</h3>
<p>Software development typically progresses in incremental steps and
requires a significant time investment. It is not realistic to expect a
complete, feature-rich application to emerge from a blank page in a
single step. The process often involves collaboration among multiple
developers, especially in larger projects where various components and
features are developed concurrently.</p>
<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is based on the principle that software
development is an incremental process involving ongoing contributions
from one or more developers. Integrating large changes is often more
complex and error-prone than incorporating smaller, incremental updates.
So, rather than waiting to integrate large, complex changes all at once,
CI encourages integrating small updates frequently to check for
conflicts and inconsistencies and ensure all parts of the codebase work
well together at all times. This becomes even more critical for larger
projects, where multiple features may be developed in parallel - CI
helps manage the complexity of merging such contributions by making
integrations a regular, manageable part of the workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="common-ci-tasks">Common CI Tasks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#common-ci-tasks"></a>
</h3>
<p>CI enables automation of a number of tasks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiling (or otherwise building) code</li>
<li>Running a test suite across multiple platforms to catch issues early
and checking test coverage to see what tests are missing</li>
<li>Verifying that the code adheres to project, team, or language style
guidelines using tools known as code linters</li>
<li>Building documentation pages from docstrings (structured
documentation embedded in the code) or other source pages</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps are typically executed as part of a structured sequence
known as a CI <em>pipeline</em> or <em>workflow</em>.</p>
<p>While there can be a learning curve when first setting up CI, a wide
variety of tools are available, and the core principles are transferable
between them, making these valuable and broadly applicable skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="ci-services-tools">CI Services &amp; Tools<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ci-services-tools"></a>
</h3>
<p>There are a wide range of CI-focused workflow services and different
tools available to support various aspects of a CI pipeline. Many of
these services have Web-based interfaces and run on cloud
infrastructure, providing easy access to scalable, platform-independent
pipelines. However, local and self-hosted options are also available for
projects that require more control or need to operate in secure
environments. Most CI tools are generally language- and tool-agnostic;
if you can run a task locally, you can likely incorporate it into a CI
pipeline.</p>

<p>You may frequently come across the term CI/CD, which refers to the
combination of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment or
Delivery (CD).</p>
<p>Whilst CI focuses on integrating and testing code changes, CD extends
the process by automating the delivery and deployment of software. This
can include building installation packages for various environments and
automatically deploying updates to test or production systems. For
example, a web application could be redeployed every time a new change
passes the CI pipeline (an example is this website - it is rebuilt each
time a change is made to one of its <a href="https://github.com/softwaresaved/byte-sized-rse" class="external-link">source
pages</a>).</p>
<p>CD helps streamline the release process for packages or applications,
for example by doing nightly builds and deploying them to a public
server for download, making it easier and faster to get working updates
into the hands of users with minimal manual intervention.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-describe-a-github-actions-workflow">How to Describe a Github Actions Workflow?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-to-describe-a-github-actions-workflow"></a>
</h3>
<p>Now before we move on to defining our workflow in GitHub Actions,
we’ll take a very brief look at a language used to describe its
workflows, called YAML.</p>
<p>Originally, the acronym stood for <em>Yet Another Markup
Language</em>, but since it’s not actually used for document markup,
it’s acronym meaning was changed to <em>YAML Aint Markup
Language</em>.</p>
<p>Essentially, YAML is based around key value pairs, for example:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">name</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Kilimanjaro</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">height_metres</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="dv">5892</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">first_scaled_by</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Hans Meyer</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Now we can also define more complex data structures too. Using YAML
arrays, for example, we could define more than one entry for
<code>first_scaled_by</code>, by replacing it with:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb2">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">first_scaled_by</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="kw">-</span><span class="at"> Hans Meyer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="kw">-</span><span class="at"> Ludwig Purtscheller</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note that similarly to languages like Python, YAML uses spaces for
indentation (2 spaces is recommended). Also, in YAML, arrays are
sequences, where the order is preserved.</p>
<p>There’s also a short form for arrays:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb3">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">first_scaled_by</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="kw">[</span><span class="at">Hans Meyer</span><span class="kw">,</span><span class="at"> Ludwig Purtscheller</span><span class="kw">]</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>We can also define nested, hierarchical structures too, using YAML
<em>maps</em>. For example:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb4">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">name</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Kilimanjaro</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">height</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="fu">value</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="dv">5892</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="fu">unit</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> metres</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="fu">measured</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">year</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="dv">2008</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">by</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Kilimanjaro 2008 Precise Height Measurement Expedition</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>We are also able to combine maps and arrays, for example:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb5">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">first_scaled_by</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="kw">-</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="fu">name</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Hans Meyer</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">date_of_birth</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> 22-03-1858</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">nationality</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> German</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="kw">-</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="fu">name</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Ludwig Purtscheller</span></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">date_of_birth</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> 22-03-1858</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">nationality</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> Austrian</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>So that’s a very brief tour of YAML, which demonstrates what we need
to know to write GitHub Actions workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="enabling-workflows-for-our-repository">Enabling Workflows for our Repository<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#enabling-workflows-for-our-repository"></a>
</h3>
<p>So let’s now create a new GitHub Actions CI workflow for our new
repository that runs our unit tests whenever a change is made.</p>
<p>Firstly, we should ensure GitHub Actions is enabled for repository.
In a browser:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go the main page for the <code>industry-skills-testing</code>
repository you created in GitHub.</li>
<li>Go to repository <code>Settings</code>.</li>
<li>From the sidebar on the left select <code>General</code>, then
<code>Actions</code> (and under that, <code>General</code>).</li>
<li>Under <code>Actions permissions</code>, ensure
<code>Allow all actions and reusable workflows</code> is selected,
otherwise, our workflows won’t run!</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="creating-our-first-workflow">Creating Our First Workflow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-our-first-workflow"></a>
</h3>
<p>Next, we need to create a new file in our repository to contain our
workflow, and it needs to be located in a particular directory location,
since GitHub Actions expects workflows to be contained within the
<code>.github/workflows</code> directory. Let’s create that director and
subdirectory now. From the repository root directory:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb6">
<h3 class="code-label">BASH<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode bash" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">mkdir</span> <span class="at">-p</span> .github/workflows</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Create and edit a new file in this directory called
<code>main.yml</code>, which will hold our workflow.</p>
<p>So first let’s specify a name for our workflow that will appear under
GitHub Actions build reports, and add the conditions that will trigger
the workflow to run:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb7">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">name</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> run-unit-tests</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">on</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> push</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>So here our workflow will run when changes are pushed to the
repository. There are <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows" class="external-link">other
events</a> we might specify instead (or as well) if we wanted, but this
is the most common.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions are described as a sequence of jobs (such as building
our code, or running some tests), and each job contains a sequence of
steps which each represent a specific “action” (such as running a
command, or obtaining code from a repository).</p>
<p>Let’s define the start of a workflow job we’ll name
<code>build-and-test</code>:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb8">
<h3 class="code-label">YAML<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode yaml" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">jobs</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">  </span><span class="fu">build-and-test</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">runs-on</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> ubuntu-latest</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>We only have one job in this workflow, but we may have many. We also
specify the operating systems on which we want this job to run. In this
case, only the latest version of Linux Ubuntu, but we could supply
others too (such as Windows, or Mac OS).</p>
<p>When the workflow is triggered, our job will run within a
<code>runner</code>, which you can think of as a freshly installed
instance of a machine running the operating system we indicate (in this
case Ubuntu).</p>
<p>Let’s now supply the concrete things we want to do in our workflow.
We can think of this as the things we need to set up and run on a fresh
machine. So within our workflow, we’ll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out our code repository</li>
<li>Install Python</li>
<li>Install our Python dependencies (which is just <code>pytest</code>
in this case)</li>
<li>Run <code>pytest</code> over our set of tests</li>
</ul>
<p>We can define these as follows:</p>

something specific. In this case, we use:</p>

tests sufficiently verify the behaviour of our code as it evolves, so we
should ensure we update our tests as necessary, and adding new tests as
required to verify new functionality.</p>

<h1 id="scrum-philosophy">Scrum Philosophy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scrum-philosophy"></a>
</h1>
<p>Scrum is an iterative and incremental approach.</p>
<p>Scrum is intentionally <strong>minimalist</strong>. It defines only
what is essential to implement Scrum theory, encouraging teams to build
on it and adapt it to their context.</p>
<p>Scrum is deliberately <strong>incomplete</strong>.It doesn’t provide
detailed instructions, but instead provides a structure to guide
interactions and relationships.</p>
<p>Scrum can be used alongside or around existing practices, processes
and frameworks.</p>
<p>Just as important as the visible elements of Scrum, such as the Scrum
Team Roles, Events and Artifacts, are the underlying values and
philosophy of Scrum. For Scrum to work effectively, you need to adopt a
mindset and way of working that is underpinned by certain values and
actions.</p>
<p>These are defined in the Scrum Guide as the Principles, Values and
Pillars.</p>
<p>They can be depicted as a temple with the key principles of
Empiricism and Lean Thinking as the foundations, the Values as the
steps, and the Pillars holding up the roof of the temple. The Scrum
Events (i.e. everything that happens in the Sprint) can be thought of as
part of the ‘roof’, and will only run effectively when the pillars,
steps, and foundations are in place.</p>

<h2 id="key-principles-of-scrum-theory">Key Principles of Scrum Theory<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#key-principles-of-scrum-theory"></a>
</h2>
<p>There are two key principles of Scrum Theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Empiricism</strong>: Decisions are based on observation and
experience, not speculation. Work is guided by evidence and continuous
learning.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lean Thinking</strong>: Focus on delivering value while
eliminating waste i.e. doing only what matters most.</li>

<p>Scrum isn’t only about what is done but how it is done. Scrum has
five values that encourage a healthy and productive working environment.
These guide the Scrum Team’s work, actions and behaviour.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Commitment - the Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and
supporting each other</li>
<li>Focus - the primary focus of the Scrum Team is the work of the
sprint to make the best possible progress toward the Sprint Goal.</li>
<li>Openness - the Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the
work and the challenges. This builds trust and surfaces problems
early.</li>
<li>Respect - Every team member is valued as capable and autonomous.
Scrum works best in an environment of mutual respect.</li>
<li>Courage - Scrum Team members need courage to tackle hard problems
and speak truthfully.</li>
</ol>
<p>Scrum isn’t just a set of meetings and roles. Scrum only works when
the team truly adopts the values it was built to support.</p>

<h1 id="scrum-pillars">Scrum Pillars<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scrum-pillars"></a>

<p>The effectiveness of Scrum relies on three core pillars, which are
built on top of the foundations of Empiricism and Lean Thinking, and the
steps of Scrum Values:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Transparency:</strong> the process and work must be
visible to those performing the work and stakeholders. Transparency is
essential for effective inspection and adaptation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inspection:</strong> the progress toward goals must be
inspected to detect problems quickly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adaptation:</strong> when problems are identified through
inspection, the team must adapt to minimise any further deviation from
the goal.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The pillars are interconnected and each one is critical to Scrum -
without transparency, inspection is misleading. Without inspection,
adaptation is impossible.</p>

<p><strong>Manipulating Burndown Charts</strong></p>
<p>An anecdote of Scrum ineffectiveness from Scrum.org describes how a
team deliberately altered their burndown chart to align exactly with the
ideal progress line on the chart. The Scrum Team said that they were
“manipulating the numbers so that the management does not bother
them”.</p>
<p>The empirical data was falsified, going against one of the key
principles of Scrum theory. This meant that the Scrum Team and wider
organisation couldn’t accurately inspect or adapt, making Sprint
Planning and Review totally ineffective activities.</p>
<p><strong>Horizon IT British Post Office Scandal</strong></p>
<p>The Post Office’s Horizon accounting software, introduced in 1999,
contained numerous bugs (e.g., duplicating ledger entries, phantom
shortfalls) that erroneously implicated hundreds of subpostmasters in
fraud.</p>
<p>The software company Fujitsu and the Post Office were aware of these
serious issues as early as 1999–2002 but concealed them from the public,
subpostmasters, and even prosecution courts. They denied errors and
pressured individuals to cover unexplained deficits, while claiming
system reliability in court.</p>
<p>This highlights the disastrous consequences that a lack of
transparency can have.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Designing a Board Game: The Solent Voyage</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Imagine you have an idea to create a board game ‘The Solent Voyage’,
about a ship that sailed from Southampton in Roman times.</p>
<p>The Product Goal is like your big vision:</p>
<p>“Create a complete, balanced, and fun strategy board game that 4
friends can play in under an hour.”</p>
<p>You may not know all the mechanics or artwork details yet, but you
know what success looks like: something playable, sharable, and maybe
even publishable.</p>
<p>The Product Backlog is your ever-evolving list of features and
ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create player roles and abilities</li>
<li>Draft simple turn mechanics for the game</li>
<li>Design custom mechanics for each role’s combat, trade, and
movement</li>
<li>Write the a comprehensive rulebook</li>
<li>Decide win/lose conditions</li>
<li>Sketch a rough paper game board</li>
<li>Design custom artwork for the board</li>
<li>Print the game board onto high quality material</li>
<li>Create quick example cards</li>
<li>Design and print cards</li>
<li>Build a scoring system</li>
<li>Run a short 20-minute test with two players</li>
<li>Run a full test with four players</li>
<li>Gather feedback from players</li>
<li>Create custom miniatures for each character</li>
</ul>
<p>Some items are critical (like the rules), others are stretch goals
(like custom miniatures). The backlog helps your team stay focused on
building toward the big idea.</p>

<p>The Sprint Backlog is the game plan for the current block of work and

<ul>
<li>A Sprint Goal.</li>
<li>A subset of the items from the Product Backlog that will be worked
on during this Sprint.</li>
<li>An actionable plan for delivering a working increment by the end of
the Sprint.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sprint Backlog is owned and maintained by the Developers. It is
likely to evolve as the team learns more about the current work but
should always stay grounded in the Sprint Goal.</p>

<p>A Sprint in Scrum is a fixed-length event, usually between one week
and one month in length. All work that is needed to achieve the Product
Goal is contained within Sprints.</p>
<p>There are four Scrum Events within a Sprint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprint Planning Meeting</li>
<li>Daily Scrum Meeting</li>
<li>Sprint Review</li>
<li>Sprint Retrospective</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the Scrum Events are designed to enable transparency and to

</h2>
<figure><img src="fig/scrum_planning.png" alt="diagram of scrum events and artifacts with sprint planning highlighted" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The Sprint Planning Meeting is the kickoff meeting for the Sprint.
During this meeting the Scrum Team will decide what’s most important,
how much can realistically get done, and how you’ll make it happen.</p>
<p>The Product Owner, Scrum Master and Developers all attend the Sprint
Planning meeting. Other people may also be invited to attend to provide
advice.</p>
<p>Sprint Planning needs to answer three questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Why is this Sprint valuable?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Product Owner explains how this Sprint will add value. For
example, what improvements or new features will benefit the users.</li>
<li>Based on this, the Scrum Team collaboratively decides on the Sprint
Goal, which should be a single, unifying goal for the Sprint.</li>
<li>The Sprint Goal must be finalised before the end of the Sprint
Planning Meeting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>What can be Done this Sprint?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Next, the Developers work with the Product Owner to select the
highest-priority Product Backlog items that they feel confident they can
complete. This might involve refining or breaking down the items to make
sure the whole Scrum Team knows what’s involved.</li>
<li>Estimating the amount of work that will fit into one Sprint can be
difficult but basing the estimates on past performance, upcoming
capacity and the Definition of Done can improve the accuracy of
estimates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>How will the chosen work get done?</strong>
<ul>
<li>For each item selected from the Product Backlog, the Developers plan
the specific tasks needed to turn ideas into a working Increment.</li>
<li>Often, Developers will break large items into smaller, more
manageable chunks that will take one day or less.</li>
<li>The Developers decide how to do the work. The Developers are in
charge of this, no one else can tell them how to build the
solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The output from your Sprint Planning Meeting should be your Sprint
Backlog including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Sprint Goal</li>
<li>The subset of items from the Product Backlog that you will work on
this Sprint</li>
<li>A plan for delivering the Increment by the end of the Sprint</li>
</ul>
<p>A Sprint Planning Meeting should be an absolute maximum of eight
hours for a one month Sprint, and should be shorter for shorter Sprints.
Time-boxing the meeting keeps the discussion focussed and allows the
Scrum Team to start making delivering value fast.</p>

<p>Read the following scenario about the Puppy Playdate Planner app and
discuss the questions at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint Planning Meeting Scenario</strong></p>
<p>Imagine your Scrum Team is working on the Puppy Playdate Planner app.
The Product Goal is: “Help puppy owners connect and organise playdates
easily.”</p>
<p>During Sprint Planning, the team agreed on this Sprint Goal: “Enable
creation of puppy profiles and the functionality to search for nearby
puppies.”</p>
<p>They selected these Product Backlog items for the Sprint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Puppy profiles (breed, age, personality, photo upload)</li>
<li>Location-based search for nearby puppy owners</li>
<li>Basic UI for profile creation and search results</li>
</ul>
<p>The Developers planned these tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design user interface wireframes and mockups</li>
<li>Develop backend APIs for profiles and search</li>
<li>Implement photo upload and location filtering</li>
<li>Write unit and integration tests</li>
<li>Conduct peer reviews and usability testing</li>
</ul>
<p>The Scrum Master noticed that the team did not discuss messaging or
playdate scheduling features and expressed concern that the Product
Owner hadn’t clarified their priority or timing.</p>
<p>Some Developers were unsure how much work they could complete due to
unfamiliarity with the photo upload and location technologies.</p>
<p>The Scrum Master reminded the team to consider the Definition of Done
and ensure the Increment would be fully integrated and tested.</p>

<figure><img src="fig/scrum_daily_meeting.png" alt="diagram of scrum events and artifacts with daily meeting highlighted" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The Scrum Team meet each day to inspect progress toward the Sprint
Goal, adapt the Sprint Backlog and adjust plans for upcoming work.</p>
<p>The Daily Scrum isn’t just a status update, it helps the Scrum
Team:</p>
<ul>
<li>See progress toward the Sprint Goal</li>
<li>Surface and solve problems faster</li>
<li>Make quick decisions</li>
<li>Reduce the need for additional meetings</li>
<li>Keep momentum going with clear next steps</li>
</ul>
<p>This meeting should usually last no longer than 15 minutes and is
usually held in the same time and place every working day of the Sprint.
The Daily Scrum can take any structure and use any techniques as long as
it focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces a plan for
the next day of work.</p>
<p>Usually each developer would cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you did yesterday</li>
<li>What you plan to do today</li>
<li>Anything that’s blocking you</li>
</ul>
<p>During a Daily Scrum Meeting, focus on exchanging information with
others in the group not just talking about what you’ve been doing.</p>
<p>The Daily Scrum Meeting isn’t the only time that Developers can
discuss and adjust their plans. Developers can also meet throughout the
day to re-adjust plans or to have more detailed discussions.</p>

<p>In this challenge, you’re going to practice conducting a Daily Scrum
Meeting in groups of four.</p>
<p>Assign one person to the Scrum Master role, they are responsible for
keeping the meeting to time and ensuring everyone get a chance to say
everything they need to. The whole meeting must be under five minutes
long.</p>
<p>Assign the three other group members to developer roles: Developer 1,
Developer 2, or Developer 3.</p>
<p>Each developer should read the information under their section below
but none of the others. This information may be important to others in
the Scrum Team.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the developers should exchange information so
that all developers end the meeting with no blockers, a clear plan for
their day and are aware of any dependencies or issues.</p>

<figure><img src="fig/scrum_review.png" alt="diagram of scrum events and artifacts with sprint review highlighted" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The Sprint Review is where the Scrum Team and stakeholders inspect
the work completed during the Sprint and discuss what to do next.</p>
<p>It’s a chance to show progress, gather feedback, and adapt the
Product Backlog if needed.</p>
<p>The Sprint Review may take the form of a demonstration and
discussion, but it should be a working session, not just a
presentation.</p>
<p>The Sprint Review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is held at the end of the Sprint</li>
<li>Focuses on how the Increment moves the product toward the Product
Goal</li>
<li>Aims to enable collaboration between the Scrum Team and stakeholders
of the product.</li>

<p>The Sprint Retrospective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the last event of the Sprint - held after the Sprint Review but
before the next Sprint Planning Meeting.</li>
<li>Focuses on inspection of team collaboration, tools, processes and
anything else that affected the Sprint to identify any changes that can
improve effectiveness.</li>
<li>Addresses any assumptions that led the team away from the Product
Goal and determines where they came from.</li>

<p><strong>Questions for Sprint Planning</strong></p>
<p>Remember to answer the following questions during the Sprint Planning
Meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is this Sprint valuable?</li>
<li>What can be Done this Sprint?</li>
<li>How will the chosen work get Done?</li>
</ul>
<p>The output from your Sprint Planning Meeting should be your Sprint
Backlog including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Sprint Goal</li>
<li>The subset of items from the Product Backlog that you will work on
this Sprint</li>
<li>A plan for delivering the Increment by the end of the Sprint</li>
