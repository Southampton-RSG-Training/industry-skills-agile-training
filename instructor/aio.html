</h3>
<p>Traditionally in academia, software and the process of writing it is
often seen as a necessary but throwaway artefact in research. For
example, there may be research questions for a given research project,
code is created to answer those questions, the code is run over some
data and analysed, and finally a publication is written based on those
results. These steps are often taken informally.</p>
<p>The terms <em>programming</em> (or even <em>coding</em>) and
<em>software engineering</em> are often used interchangeably. They are
not. Programmers or coders tend to focus on one part of software
development: implementation, more than any other. In academic research,
often they are writing software for themselves, where they are their own
stakeholders. And ideally, they write software from a design that
fulfills a research goal to publish research papers.</p>
<p>Someone who is engineering software takes a wider view:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>lifecycle</em> of software: recognises that software
development is a <em>process</em> that proceeds from understanding what
is needed, to writing the software and using/releasing it, to what
happens afterwards.</li>
<li>Who will (or may) be involved: software is written for
<em>stakeholders</em>. This may only be the researcher initially, but
there is an understanding that others may become involved later (even if
that is not evident yet). A good rule of thumb is to always assume that
code will be read and used by others later on, which includes
yourself!</li>
<li>Software (or code) is an asset: software inherently contains value -
for example, in terms of what it can do, the lessons learned throughout
its development, and as an implementation of a research approach (i.e. a
particular research algorithm, process, or technical approach).</li>
<li>As an asset, it could be reused: again, it may not be evident
initially that the software will have use beyond its initial purpose or
project, but there is an assumption that the software - or even just a
part of it - could be reused in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking about software engineering from that wider view, there are
some typical stages that a software development project would go through
and these are ver similar to the stages of any project.</p>

<p><strong>Solo Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Think about a project you’ve completed in the past. This could be a
software project but it doesn’t have to be. It could be anything from
organising an event to completing a personal goal or managing a work
task.</p>
<p>If you were to break down that project into stages, what would the
stages be?</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="software-development-process">Software Development Process<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#software-development-process"></a>
</h3>
<p>The typical stages of a software development process are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Requirements gathering:</strong> the process of identifying
and recording the exact requirements for a software project before it
begins. This helps maintain a clear direction throughout development,
and sets clear targets for what the software needs to do.</li>
<li>
<strong>Design:</strong> where the requirements are translated into
an overall design for the software. It covers what will be the basic
software ‘components’ and how they will fit together, as well as the
tools and technologies that will be used, which will together address
the requirements identified in the first stage.</li>
<li>
<strong>Implementation:</strong> the software is developed according
to the design, implementing the solution that meets the requirements set
out in the requirements gathering stage.</li>
<li>
<strong>Testing:</strong> the software is tested with the intent to
discover and rectify any defects, and also to ensure that the software
meets its defined requirements, i.e. does it actually do what it should
do reliably?</li>
<li>
<strong>Deployment:</strong> where the software is deployed or in
some way released, and used for its intended purpose within its intended
environment.</li>
<li>
<strong>Maintenance:</strong> where updates are made to the software
to ensure it remains fit for purpose, which typically involves fixing
any further discovered issues and evolving it to meet new or changing
requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>These stages are followed implicitly or explicitly in every software
project but there are many different ways to arrange them. The stages
may be arranged according to an established model of software
development.</p>

<figure><img src="../fig/waterfall.png" alt="diagram of the waterfall model" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The Waterfall Model is a software development methodology in which
the typical stages of the software development process (that we outlined
above) are followed step-by-step in a set, sequential order.</p>
<p>The Waterfall Model is effective when used for projects where the
requirements are clearly defined from the outset. It is ideal for
projects with long timelines and minimal tolerance for errors, where
stakeholders require high confidence in the final outcome.</p>

Crossrail project</a> (later rebranded as the Elizabeth Line) used a
Waterfall approach of clear, sequential phases. This approach was
appropriate because the requirements were known from the start, with
little possibility for change throughout the project. The line spans
118km, serving 41 stations (10 new) and had been used for over 500
million journeys by early 2025 since its opening in 2022. Despite the
project delays and overspend, the Elizabeth Line was widely praised as
an engineering triumph.</p>

<p>However, there are some disadvantages to the Waterfall Model:</p>
<ul>
<li>The model is relatively inflexible. Once a phase is completed, the
model does not account for going back to make changes and therefore
there is no mechanism for error correction.</li>
<li>The model assumes that project requirements are fully defined from
the beginning, which is rarely the case for smaller, non-critical
software projects, particularly in research.</li>
<li>The software is not seen by the client until late in the project
timeline, which may increase the risk of it not meeting the client’s
expectations.</li>

of public transport. Almost $1 billion was committed to this project in
July 2005.</p>
<p>The project was expected to be completed in two years but ended up
taking over nine years in total and the budgeted cost was exceeded by
55%. Furthermore, due to the rigidly fixed scope and upfront planning,
the system could not adapt to evolving user expectations or new
technologies. The system was plagued by multiple issues including
overcharging, slow touch readers, top-up delays and limited device
compatibility.</p>
<p>These issues were all symptomatic of the inflexible development
process.</p>

<p>The concept of the V-model was developed simultaneously, but
independently, in Germany and in the United States in the late
1980s.</p>
<p>The V-Model emphasises the importance of validating each level of the
software development. This approach ensures that verification (checking
work during development) and validation (checking final products against
requirements) are systematically integrated throughout the process.</p>
<p>The left side of the V includes creation and verification steps,
i.e. does it work according to the specification.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Requirements gathering</p></li>
<li><p>System design</p></li>
<li><p>Architectural design</p></li>
<li><p>Module design</p></li>
<li><p>Coding</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The right side of the V includes validation for each step, i.e. have
you built the right thing</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unit testing (validation for module design)</p></li>
<li><p>Integration testing (validation for architectural
design)</p></li>
<li><p>System testing (validation for system design)</p></li>
<li><p>User acceptance testing (validation for requirements
gathering)</p></li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="../fig/v-model.png" alt="image of the v-model of software development" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The V-Model is used in safety-critical, regulated industries where
traceability, formal verification and compliance with standards are

<p>In many cases, it doesn’t make sense for software development to
follow a linear process such as the Waterfall or V model for a number of
reasons. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes to a design mean that the requirements must be adjusted</li>
<li>A company may build on the same project for years, adding more
complexity</li>
<li>The design of a key algorithm may need changing, leading to a need
to change the implementation</li>
<li>A mistake is could be found during deployment which requires changes
to the implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>In iterative development, a large application is built in smaller,
manageable parts called iterations. Each iteration includes planning,
design, development, and testing, and produces a working version of the
product. Unlike the Waterfall and V models, where the entire product is
developed at once, iterative development adds features incrementally,
with each cycle enhancing the functionality of the product.</p>

<p>The Spiral Model, sometimes known as Boehm’s Spiral, is an iterative,
risk-driven approach to software development. The approach allows for
any mixture of software development approaches depending on the pattern
of risk present in the project. The model guides users to first
determine objectives, second identify and resolve risks, third develop
and test, and fourth plan the next iteration. More recently, the spiral
model has been thought of as a ‘process model generator’ because Boehm
argues that choices based on a project’s risks generate an appropriate
process model for the project.</p>
<p>Decisions about how much effort should be directed into each element
of the project is guided by the goal of minimising the overall risk.</p>

</h4>
<p>Agile software development is a phrase used to describe any iterative
method which broadly follows a set of principles determined by a group
of 17 software developers, called the Agile Alliance, at a meeting in
Utah in 2001. These principles, outlined in the Manifesto for Agile
Software Development, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</p></li>
<li><p>Working software over comprehensive documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</p></li>
<li><p>Responding to change over following a plan</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Agile Manifesto was inspired by the desire for a more rapid and
lightweight approach to software development, as an alternative to the
more heavyweight processes such as Waterfall and V-Model. It drew on
ideas from existing lightweight software development methods such as
rapid application development, the rational unified process aka RUP,
dynamic systems development method, scrum, extreme programming and
feature driven development. Although these methods were developed in the
1990s, before the Agile Manifesto, they are now all referred to under
the umbrella term ‘Agile’ and, with the exception of Scrum, these
methods have now gone out of fashion.</p>

<p>Advantages of Iterative Development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Progress on the software product can initially be faster as less
time is spent on the requirements and design stages before starting
implementation</li>
<li>Iterative approaches allow for continuous feedback, adaptation, and
improvement throughout the project’s lifecycle.</li>
<li>Defects can be found and corrected early, preventing them from
affecting later stages.</li>
<li>After each iteration, feedback can be gathered from users, allowing
for adjustments and improvements to meet their expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages of Iterative Development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without fully determined requirements and design, software can
become messy or ‘hacky’ if quality control standards are not
maintained</li>
<li>Since not all requirements are defined from the start, unforeseen
changes may arise during the development process which require revision
of the software architecture, costing more time in the long run.</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Any model can be used for any software development project. Waterfall
and V-Model and more likely to be used when all the requirements are
known at the start of the project. Iterative methods are particularly
suited to prototyping, where quick development and user feedback help
shape early versions of a system, and to research software, where
evolving requirements and experimental objectives demand adaptability.
However, iterative approaches can be used on any project including those
which are large scale and safety critical.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that, to some extent, linear approaches become
iterative in reality, as it is nearly always necessary to return to
previous stages throughout the software development process. For
example, knowing 100% of the requirements from the start is nearly
always impossible. Even if a waterfall approach is applied, changes will
most likely be made at each of the stages, requiring revision of an
earlier stage.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Scrum is an Agile delivery technique that guides the actual software
development process. Scrum is concerned with delivering a project
i.e. doing the actual software engineering.</p>
<p>Project management is concerned with all aspects of a project
including planning, executing, and closing projects, as well as managing
change and risk within a project. Project management may contain Scrum
but will also cover the wider project aspects including ensuring that a
project meets its goals, timeline, and budget.</p>
<p>There are lots of project management frameworks.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion we should distinguish between Scrum (an Agile
delivery technique) and Agile Project Management (AgilePM), which
involves the application of Agile principles to managing projects.
AgilePM emphasises transparency, flexibility and meeting customer need,
as well as allowing teams to have autonomy, make shared decisions and
self-organise.</p>
<p>Another popular project management framework is PRINCE2 (PRojects IN
Controlled Environments), which was developed by the UK government, and
outlines seven principles, seven themes and seven processes to guide how
a project should be managed. It is a more heavyweight project management
framework than Agile Project Management and so is often used in sectors
where governance and documentation are priorities.</p>

capturing the needs of a project,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>User stories</em>, which capture what is needed from solely the
perspective of the client</li>
<li>
<em>Requirements</em>, which state what needs to be built (or what
needs to change) by the development team</li>
</ul>
<p>So whilst they both capture what the software will do, each reflects
one side of the client/developer perspective.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="user-stories-understanding-what-is-needed-from-the-user-perspective">User Stories: Understanding what is Needed from the User
Perspective<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#user-stories-understanding-what-is-needed-from-the-user-perspective"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Capturing “requirements” is pivotal to understanding what needs to be
built, but whilst they state what is technically required, they lack the
end-user context of what they are and why they are important. User
stories aim to capture this perspective, being short and simple
descriptions of new features or functionality from the perspective of
the end user themselves. Therefore, user stories help:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project remains <em>user-centered</em> and <em>focused on real
needs</em>, rather than jumping prematurely to solution or technical
requirements</li>
<li>To clarify the the <em>value</em> behind a feature, and anchor
development in <em>user outcomes</em>, not just functionality</li>
<li>Prevent requirements ballooning, if not guided by real user
goals</li>
<li>Prioritise what matters to users</li>
</ul>
<p>They typically follow the following template, to ensure user stories
are clear and concise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a <em>[type of user]</em>, I want <em>[an action]</em> so that
<em>[benefit]</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Breaking each of these three aspects down:</p>
<ul>
<li>“As a <em>[type of user]</em>”: who are we building this for? There
may be more than one type of user, but in any case we need to think
about this from the user’s perspective.</li>
<li>“I want <em>[an action]</em>”: this describes the intent of this
type of user, not the features of the system. What do they want to
achieve?</li>
<li>“so that <em>[benefit]</em>”: what is the benefit they are trying to
realise? How will it help them directly, solve a problem for them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of user stories include:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-commerce site: as a shopper, I want to add items to my cart so
that I can purchase multiple products at once</li>
<li>Mobile application: as a user, I want to receive push notifications
for important updates so that I stay informed when I’m not using the
app</li>
</ul>

requirements</p>

<p>Consider this scenario:</p>
<p><em>“A small town cheese-making business has received many enquiries
about being able to make online purchases delivered to their homes or
place of business, and so now want to also sell their many types of
cheeses using an online store. Online customers are looking to be able
to search the store, select cheeses to purchase, and when ready, add
payment and shipping details and confirm the order. There is some
evidence that some online customers are environmentally and ecologically
conscious, so are interested in the environmental impacts of products.
In order to schedule their supply chains efficiently, business customers
are keen to have updates on shipping. From the perspective of the
business owner, they want to able to manage available stock inventory on
the online store.”</em></p>
<p>Identify at least two types of user - also known as <em>personas</em>
- that would use the store. From the above scenario, create at least
four user stories using this format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a <em>[type of user]</em>, I want <em>[an action]</em> so that
<em>[benefit]</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hint: focus on the user needs, not what may be implementated.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In general, a requirement is a <em>capability or condition that must
be met for software to solve a problem or address a need</em>. They form
the foundation of our project and drive what will be developed, so if we
do not properly explore and understand what is required, the software
will not be suitable for it’s intended purpose.</p>
<p>Whilst user stories focus purely on the user perspective,
requirements concentrate on what technically needs to change. For this
reason, it’s common to develop user stories first (to understand the
user), then from those stories, derive requirements (to understand what
needs to be built). Requirements typically address technical aspects of
software functionality and features that are needed to complete a user
story, and are more numerous than the collection of user stories.
Therefore, each user story is often addressed by more than one
requirement.</p>
<p>There is repeated evidence that most errors aren’t actually
introduced during the software development stage, but during
requirements analysis and design. For example, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ISRE.1993.324825" class="external-link">one analysis</a> of the
software errors uncovered during integration and testing and the Voyager
(1977) and Galileo (1989) probes discovered that 79% of these errors
were due to a poor understanding of requirements.</p>
<p>However, it is unlikely that we will be able to determine all of the
requirements correctly and completely upfront. In practice, very often
requirements may need be flexible to some extent and may change as the
project evolves, so we need to ensure we are able to accommodate any
agreed changes.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="requirements-are-more-than-just-features">Requirements are More than just Features<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#requirements-are-more-than-just-features"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>When considering software requirements, it is very tempting to just
think about the features users need. However, many design choices in a
software project depend on the users themselves and the environment in
which the software is expected to run (as well as <em>how</em> the
software should run), and these aspects should be considered as part of
the software’s <em>non-functional</em> requirements.</p>
<p>To explore the importance of this aspect, let’s consider two software
types, mobile applications and embedded software. They may appear
similar, but examining the environments in which they are developed and
operate uncovers many differences that need to be accounted for in order
for the software to be fit for purpose.</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col width="26%">
<col width="30%">
<col width="42%">
</colgroup>
<thead><tr class="header">
<th>Concern</th>
<th>Mobile Apps</th>
<th>Embedded Software</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Platform</td>
<td>Work on range of mobile hardware and iOS/Android operating
systems</td>
<td>Exact specification of hardware is known - often not necessary to
support multiple devices; typically low power</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Development Language</td>
<td>Typically written in one of the higher-level platform preferred
languages (e.g. Java, Kotlin, Swift)</td>
<td>Typically lower-level language (e.g. C) for better control of
resources</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Compilation</td>
<td>Users will not (usually) modify / compile the software</td>
<td>Users will not (usually) modify / compile the software</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>Installation</td>
<td>Usually distributed via a controlled app store</td>
<td>Usually distributed pre-installed on a physical device</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Interface</td>
<td>Must have graphical interface suitable for a touch display</td>
<td>May have no user interface, or interface may be physical
buttons</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Documentation</td>
<td>Probably in the software itself or on a Web page</td>
<td>Documentation probably in a technical manual with a separate user
manual</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Uptime</td>
<td>May not run continuously due to restarts</td>
<td>May need to run continuously for the lifetime of the device</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Therefore, whilst a single piece of software may provide the same
<em>functionality</em> on a mobile app or embedded device (for example,
a photo frame application), the other <em>non-functional</em>
considerations describe facets of how the software must be developed and
how it must operate (often as constraints), and we must account for them
in our requirements.</p>

<p>Think about some software you are familiar with (could be software
you have written yourself or by someone else) and how the environment it
is used in has affected its design or development. Here are some
examples of questions you can use to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>What environment does the software run in?</li>
<li>How do people interact with it?</li>
<li>What features of the software have been affected by these
factors?</li>

<ul>
<li>Has a graphical interface for use with mouse and keyboard</li>
<li>May need to work on multiple, very different operating systems</li>
<li>May be intended for users to modify / compile themselves</li>
<li>Should work on a wide range of hardware configurations</li>
<li>Documentation probably either in a manual or in the software

</ul>
<p>Command-line Application - Linux Tool</p>
<ul>
<li>User interface is text based, probably via command-line
arguments</li>
<li>Intended to be modified / compiled by users - though most will
choose not to</li>
<li>Documentation has standard formats - also accessible from the
command line</li>
<li>Should be usable as part of a pipeline</li>
</ul>
<p>Command-line Application - High Performance Computing</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to a UNIX Tool</li>
<li>Usually supports running across multiple networked machines
simultaneously</li>
<li>Usually operated via a scheduler - interface should be
scriptable</li>
<li>May need to run on a wide range of hardware (e.g. different CPU
architectures)</li>
<li>May need to process large amounts of data</li>
<li>Often entirely or partially written in a lower-level language for
performance (e.g. C, C++, Fortran)</li>
</ul>
<p>Web Application</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually has components which run on server and components which run
on the user’s device</li>
<li>Graphical interface should usually support both Desktop and Mobile
devices</li>
<li>Client-side component should run on a range of browsers and

<p>A <em>product backlog</em> is a prioritised list of functionality
that a product should contain; essentially, a list of work for the
development team. It represents everything that might be needed in the
product and is the single source of truth for all work. They include
requirement-related aspects such as features, bugs, improvements, and
non-functional requirements, but also any other supporting tasks such as
any needed research (also known as <em>spikes</em>), and other
implementation-related tasks (like cleaning up/refactoring code).</p>
<p>A product backlog is owned by the <em>product owner</em> (the
client), and is dynamic, in that it evolves as the needs of the product
evolves. Regular backlog refinement sessions throughout a project ensure
items are updated, estimated, re-prioritised if necessary, and ready for
upcoming sprints.</p>

<p>For a given repository, GitHub provides <em>Issues</em> - a framework
for managing bug reports, feature requests, and lists of future work
which is ideal for our needs.</p>
<p>Go back to the home page for your repository in GitHub, and click on
the <code>Issues</code> tab. You should see a page listing the open
issues on your repository - currently there should be none. The issues
we add here will form our product backlog.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Managing our issues as presented in the <code>Issues</code> page is
helpful as a view to everything that’s being done, but it gives a
relative flat representation of tasks and it’s not straightforward to
determine, at a glance, the overall status of a project. In
particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s still to do</li>
<li>What’s currently in progress</li>
<li>What’s been completed</li>
</ul>
<p>This is particularly the case when we have many issues for a given
project, and more than one person working on them.</p>
<p>In an agile Scrum sense, if we’re currently in a sprint (or preparing
for one in a sprint planning session) it would be beneficial to have a
way to visualise and manage this information efficiently. GitHub does
provide <em>Milestones</em> as an organisational mechanism, where we are
able to group issues together in logical lists, but this approach also
has similar limitations at scale. In addition, a key technique in agile
approaches is frequent prioritisation, and that’s difficult to do
without a higher-level approach.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="github-projects">GitHub Projects<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#github-projects"></a>
</h3>
<p>GitHub Projects enable ways of organising issues into smaller
“sub-projects” (i.e. smaller than the “project” represented by the whole
repository). Projects provide a way of visualising and organising work
which is not time-bound and is on a higher level, which makes management
easier.</p>
<p>Milestones are typically used to organise lower-level tasks that have
deadlines and progress of which needs to be closely tracked
(e.g. release and version management). The main difference is that
Milestones are a repository-level feature (i.e. they belong and are
managed from a single repository), whereas projects are account-level,
and can manage tasks across many repositories under the same user or
organisational account. This is particularly useful for larger projects
with development across multiple repositories (for example, with
client-side code in one repository and server-side code in another).
This enables the development team to manage issues on these repositories
under a single project board, if desired.</p>
<p>Conceptually, for our purposes a GitHub Project is a “project board”,
which originated as a tool used by Toyota in the 1940s called the
“Kanban” system. Kanban-style boards consists of columns and cards to
keep track of tasks. You break down your project into smaller
sub-projects, which in turn are split into tasks which you write on
cards, then move the cards between columns that describe the status of
each task. Cards are usually small, descriptive and self-contained tasks
that build on each other. Breaking a project down into clearly-defined
tasks makes it a lot easier to manage.</p>
<p>In GitHub, a project board adopts this Kanban-style, with entries on
the board either being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Cards</em> - a short note which belongs only to the Project
Board</li>
<li>
<em>Issues</em> - essentially GitHub issues imported from a
repository (or many repositories)</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as a Kanban-style boards, GitHub Projects also supports other
types of view too, including roadmap views, table-based views, or as a
spreadsheet. For the purposes of this training, we’ll use the boards
view.</p>

<p>5 mins.</p>
<p>To use a project board in GitHub, it needs to be created and shared
with the rest of the group.</p>
<p>Firstly, select one of the team to create the board, who will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>On the group repository’s main page, select <code>Projects</code>,
then <code>New Project</code>. <img src="../fig/github-board-project-link.png" class="image-with-shadow figure" alt="Link to create a project board" width="1000">

<li>In the <code>Create Project</code> pop-up window, we are presented
with some styles to choose from: <code>Table</code>, <code>Board</code>
and <code>Roadmap</code>. Select <code>Board</code>.</li>
<li>Decide and enter a name for the board, <code>Coffee Analysis</code>
for example: <img src="../fig/github-board-create.png" class="image-with-shadow figure" alt="Create a project board in GitHub" width="1000">
</li>
</ol>
<p>Similarly to how the repository was shared with the rest of the
group, the project board also needs to be shared:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select the <code>...</code> in the top right and select `Settings:
<img src="../fig/github-board-settings.png" class="image-with-shadow figure" alt="Access settings for a project board" width="1000">

<li>Select <code>Manage access</code> from the navigation bar on the

<li>Under <code>Invite collaborators</code>, add each member of the
group by adding their username.</li>
<li>Set each member’s permissions under <code>Manage access</code> to
<code>Write</code> or <code>Admin</code> so they are able to make
changes to the board.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<p>Once created, you should see the default layout for a GitHub board,
with three columns: <code>Todo</code>, <code>In Progress</code>, and

them.</p>

<p>If you select <code>+ Add item</code> at the bottom of the
<code>Todo</code> column, you’ll be able to enter some text. If you
continue to add arbitrary text, this will create a board card, but
instead, we want to add issues from our repository. To do this, type
<code>#</code> followed by your repository name,
e.g. <code>#coffee-analysis</code>.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Once we have an initial set of requirements captured, we need to
understand their importance in relation to each other: essentially we
need to prioritise them.</p>
<p>But before we can prioritise our requirements, there are some things
we need to find out.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The period of time we have to resolve these requirements</em> -
e.g. before the next software release, pivotal demonstration, or other
deadlines requiring their completion. This is known as a
<strong>timebox</strong>. This might be a week or two, but for agile,
this should not be longer than a month. Longer deadlines with more
complex requirements may be split into a number of timeboxes.</li>
<li>
<em>How much overall effort we have available</em> - i.e. who will
be involved and how much of their time we will have during this
period.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need estimates for how long each requirement will take to
resolve, since it’s difficult to meaningfully prioritise requirements
without knowing what the effort tradeoffs will be. Even if we know how
important each requirement is, how would we even know if completing the
project is possible? Or if we do not know how long it will take to
deliver those requirements we deem to be critical to the success of a
project, how can we know if we can include other less important
ones?</p>
<p>It is often not the reality in practice, but estimation should
ideally be done by the people likely to do the actual work: the
developers themselves. It shouldn’t be done by project managers or those
otherwise not involved in development, simply because they are not best
placed to estimate, and those doing the work are the ones who are
effectively committing to these figures. As well as lacking the inherent
technical skills required to estimate, having senior non-development
roles dictating estimates is that they are at risk of non-development
biases such as idealised project timelines and goals which may not be
achievable.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="t-shirt-estimation">T-Shirt Estimation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#t-shirt-estimation"></a>
</h3>
<p>One method typically used in agile for estimation is <em>t-shirt
estimation</em>. Instead of applying specific estimates of time to
complete each requirement or task, you instead assign a t-shirt size to
each in order to estimate their size <em>relative to each other</em>.
T-shirt estimation is a far simpler method that emphasises simplicity,
speed, and collaboration in early stages of a project where details are
often vague.</p>
<p>Some example sizes might be:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead><tr class="header">
<th>Size</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Rough time estimate</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>XS</td>
<td>Very quick and easy</td>
<td>&lt; 1 day</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>S</td>
<td>Small effort</td>
<td>1-2 days</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>M</td>
<td>Medium effort</td>
<td>2-4 days</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>L</td>
<td>Large effort</td>
<td>5-7 days</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>XL</td>
<td>Very large or unclear</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So for any tasks judged to be <code>XL</code>, this implies it needs
to be clarified and/or broken down into further tasks.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Solo Exercise: Apply T-shirt Estimates to your Product Backlog</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>5 mins.</p>
<p>On your own, quickly apply the t-shirt estimation technique to the
issues in your product backlog, noting down your estimates. Use the
following categories, which have a greatly reduced time scale:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead><tr class="header">
<th>Size</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Rough time estimate</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>XS</td>
<td>Very quick and easy</td>
<td>&lt; 10 mins</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>S</td>
<td>Small effort</td>
<td>10-30 mins</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>M</td>
<td>Medium effort</td>
<td>1-2 hours</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>L</td>
<td>Large effort</td>
<td>2-5 hours</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>XL</td>
<td>Very large or unclear</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>An effective way of helping to make your estimates more accurate is
to do it as a team. Other members can ask prudent questions that may not
have been considered, and bring in other sanity checks and their own
development experience. Just talking things through can help uncover
other complexities and pitfalls, and raise crucial questions to clarify
ambiguities.</p>

<p>As a group, reveal your individual estimates for each requirement -

majority size. For those that have equal votes, decide quickly as a
group on the final size.</p>
<p>Have one member lead the discussion for a requirement, and rotate
this role until all requirement estimates have been decided, such that
every member leads the discussion at least once.</p>
<p>Once you have a list of final sizes, add each agreed size as a
comment to its corresponding issue in your product backlog.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Why is it so Difficult to Estimate?</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Estimation is a very valuable skill to learn, and one that is often
difficult. Lack of experience in estimation can play a part, but a
number of psychological causes can also contribute. One of these is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" class="external-link">Dunning-Kruger</a>,
a type of cognitive bias in which people tend to overestimate their
abilities, whilst in opposition to this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" class="external-link">imposter
syndrome</a>, where due to a lack of confidence people underestimate
their abilities. The key message here is to be honest about what you can
do, and find out as much information that is reasonably appropriate
before arriving at an estimate.</p>
<p>More experience in estimation will also help to reduce these effects.
So keep estimating!</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<ul>
<li>Avoid mapping sizes to exact hours/days too early</li>
<li>Focus on relative sizing between stories</li>
<li>Discuss outliers - why does someone see it as an XL when others see
M?</li>
<li>Use the discussion to uncover unknowns or assumptions about the
requirements, and clarify them in the product backlog</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>To an extent, the <em>process</em> of deciding estimates is more
important than the actual result of estimation. Creating estimates
forces the team to consider the detail of what will be required to
fulfil a requirement, beyond just coming up with a number. For example,
when coming up with an estimate it may become clear there are unrealised
dependencies between tasks, or some requirements are not readily
estimable due to being too complex or too widely scoped, and require
further decomposition into multiple smaller requirements to estimate
properly. It may also become clear that some requirements may not be
achievable at all within the timeframe of the project!</p>
</div>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="prioritisation">Prioritisation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#prioritisation"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now we have our estimates we can decide how important each
requirement is to the success of the project. This should be decided by
the project stakeholders; those - or their representatives - who have a
stake in the success of the project and are either directly affected or
affected by the project, e.g. clients, end-users, collaborators,
etc.</p>
<p>To prioritise these requirements we can use a method called
<strong>MoSCoW</strong>, a way to reach a common understanding with
stakeholders on the importance of successfully delivering each
requirement for a timebox. MoSCoW is an acronym that stands for
<strong>Must have</strong>, <strong>Should have</strong>, <strong>Could
have</strong>, and <strong>Won’t have</strong>. Each requirement is
discussed by the stakeholder group and falls into one of these
categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Must Have</em> (MH) - these requirements are critical to the
current timebox for it to succeed. Even the inability to deliver just
one of these would cause the project to be considered a failure.</li>
<li>
<em>Should Have</em> (SH) - these are important requirements but not
<em>necessary</em> for delivery in the timebox. They may be as
<em>important</em> as Must Haves, but there may be other ways to achieve
them or perhaps they can be held back for a future development
timebox.</li>
<li>
<em>Could Have</em> (CH) - these are desirable but not necessary,
and each of these will be included in this timebox if it can be
achieved.</li>
<li>
<em>Won’t Have</em> (WH) - these are agreed to be out of scope,
perhaps because they are the least important or not critical for this
phase of development.</li>
</ul>
<p>In typical use, the ratio to aim for of requirements to the MH/SH/CH
categories is 60%/20%/20% for a particular timebox. Importantly, the
division is by the requirement <em>estimates</em>, not by number of
requirements, so 60% means 60% of the overall estimated effort for
requirements are Must Haves.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Because it gives you a unique degree of
control of your project for each time period. It awards you 40% of
flexibility with allocating your effort depending on what’s critical and
how things progress. This effectively forces a tradeoff between the
effort available and critical objectives, maintaining a significant
safety margin. The idea is that as a project progresses, even if it
becomes clear that you are only able to deliver the Must Haves for a
particular time period, you have still delivered it
<em>successfully</em>.</p>

admits they didn’t understand a word. They leave the meeting unclear on
what’s being done, why it’s needed, or how it affects their goals.</p>
<p>This kind of miscommunication is surprisingly common. It stems from
the <strong>Expert Awareness Gap</strong> (also known as the Curse of
Knowledge), a disconnect between experts and non-experts, where the
expert unintentionally assumes that others share their knowledge,
context, or mental models, when they do not. This is because experts
internalise concepts so deeply that they become automatic and invisible
to them. In this context, software engineers may assume non-technical
stakeholders share their understanding of technical concepts that have
become second nature. As a result, clients may feel confused, excluded,
or unsure how to make informed decisions.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/bridge_the_gap.jpg" alt="Lizard jumping across a large gap" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Photo by Denny Luan on Unsplash</div>
</figure><p>To bridge this gap, and build shared understanding, try the following
techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use analogies or plain language.</strong><br>
For example, instead of saying <em>“we’re refactoring the code,”</em>
try <em>“we’re tidying up the code to make it easier and safer to change
in the future.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expand acronyms even if they seem obvious.</strong><br>
Don’t assume clients know what CI/CD (Continuous Integration /
Continuous Deployment), API (Application Programming Interface), or JWT
(JSON Web Token) mean. A good rule is to expand any acronym at least the
first time you use it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connect technical changes to client value.</strong><br>
For instance, rather than saying <em>“we’re upgrading the
framework,”</em> say <em>“we’re upgrading the framework to reduce bugs
and give us access to modern features that improve security and
performance.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Frame decisions in terms of the client’s
goals.</strong><br>
When discussing trade-offs, explain how technical choices affect things
like user experience, compliance, or costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use visuals to support understanding.</strong><br>
Diagrams, such as flowcharts, can help convey complex ideas without
relying on jargon.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By learning to speak the client’s language you build their trust,
enable better decision making, and avoid frustration on both sides.</p>

</h2>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> In a client meeting, a developer says,
<em>“Yes, we should be able to add that feature by the end of the
sprint.”</em> The client is pleased. However, a week later, it becomes
clear that the feature is more complex than expected, other tasks are
behind schedule, and the team now has to explain the delay. The client
feels frustrated and blindsided and this impacts the trust they have in
your development team.</p>
<p>This is a classic example of unrealistic expectations, often caused
by optimism, pressure to please, or fear of disappointing the client in
the moment.</p>
<p>Setting realistic expectations is one of the most important parts of
client communication. It helps prevent misunderstandings, reduces
stress, and builds long-term trust.</p>

<li><p><strong>Under-promise, over-deliver</strong><br>
Clients would rather be pleasantly surprised than disappointed. Estimate
conservatively, it’s better to deliver something early or with extra
polish than to miss a deadline.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build in contingency time</strong><br>
Always allow for the unexpected. Think carefully about what could go
wrong (technical complexity, team availability, integration issues), and
factor that into your estimates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid committing on the spot</strong><br>
Don’t feel pressured to promise something immediately. It’s entirely
professional to say:<br><em>“Let me check with the team and get back to you this
afternoon.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be honest about trade-offs and limitations</strong><br>
For example:<br><em>“We can deliver this in two weeks, but without automated testing. If
you want it tested properly, we’ll need an extra week.”</em></p></li>

<h3 id="timeboxing">Timeboxing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#timeboxing"></a>

<p>Timeboxing is where you allocate a fixed amount of time to an issue
and stop when that time is up, regardless of whether the issue has been
resolved. Timeboxing can be useful when the work is exploratory or
uncertain because it:</p>
<ul>
<li>makes transparent to the client how much time is being allocated to
learning or discovery, which may not be clear from observable progress
on the product.</li>
<li>helps avoid analysis paralysis (getting stuck on one issue
indefinitely)</li>
<li>controls the risk when the outcome is uncertain</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: <em>“Since we’re not yet sure how complex this
integration is, we’ll allocate 2 days to investigate. We’ll regroup
after that to decide the next steps based on what we learn.”</em></p>
<p>Sprints are a example of timeboxing. You might also timebox a product
backlog item within a Sprint.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A client approaches your team with a
vision for a meal-planning app. They want grocery shopping integration,
dietary preference tracking, AI-generated recipes, video tutorials, and
a sleek mobile interface, all delivered within eight weeks. You explain
that the scope is too large for the timeline, but the client insists
each feature is essential. Without clear prioritisation, the team
attempts to build everything and ends up delivering an unstable app that
fails to meet user expectations. The client is disappointed, and trust
is damaged.</p>
<p>This kind of situation is common. Clients are often enthusiastic and
ambitious, but may not understand the trade-offs involved. That’s why
<strong>clear prioritisation discussions</strong> are essential.</p>

<p>There’s rarely enough time or budget to build every requested
feature. Prioritisation helps focus resources on what truly matters,
ensuring that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The product can launch on time.</li>
<li>Key user needs are met early.</li>
<li>The team can iterate and improve based on real feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Introducing the concept of the <strong>Minimum Viable Product
(MVP)</strong> can help clients shift from “everything now” to “what’s
essential first.”</p>

<h3 id="the-mvp-a-strategic-starting-point">The MVP: A Strategic Starting Point<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-mvp-a-strategic-starting-point"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <strong>MVP</strong> is a basic, working version of the product
that delivers the product’s core value. It’s not the final product, but
it’s enough to test with users and validate the idea.</p>
<p>For instance, imagine that the client wants you to build a car. The
core value is a structure with wheels that can get you from A to B, so
the MVP might be a skateboard.</p>

<li>Be prepared to explain technical dependencies (e.g. why Feature A

<li>Remind clients that starting small doesn’t mean thinking small - a
more complex product can be built on top of the MVP but only when the
bare essentials are in place.</li>

<p>The three key objectives of a kickoff meeting are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Agree prioritised requirements</strong>: Work with the
client to review and prioritise the product backlog. While the final
decision rests with the client, prioritisation should be a two-way
conversation. Developers should feel confident advocating for items they
believe are critical, especially technical tasks that may not appear
important to non-technical stakeholders but are essential for enabling
future features or maintaining system stability.</li>
<li>
<strong>Set expectations</strong>: Establish a shared understanding
of what will be delivered, when, and to what standard. This includes
clarifying timelines, defining the scope of work for early iterations
(such as the MVP), and agreeing on communication channels and response
times. Setting clear expectations upfront helps reduce misunderstandings
and prevents scope creep later in the project.</li>
<li>
<strong>Resolve ambiguity</strong>: Clarify any unclear or vague
requirements before development begins. This may involve asking the
client to define specific terms, provide examples, or explain business
rules in detail. The goal is to remove guesswork and ensure that both
the development team and the client share the same understanding of what
is being built and why.</li>

<p>It’s helpful to take notes in a shared document (e.g., google doc)
that everyone can access. This way, if any updates are made, everyone
can see them straight away.</p>
<p>Send a summary email containing the meeting notes within 24 hours of
the meeting to confirm that everyone is on the same page.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to use consistent formating across meetings for
clarity (e.g., bullet points or a table).</p>

<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="scrum-philosophy">Scrum Philosophy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scrum-philosophy"></a>
</h1>
<p>Scrum is an iterative and incremental approach.</p>
<p>Scrum is intentionally <strong>minimalist</strong>. It defines only
what is essential to implement Scrum theory, encouraging teams to build
on it and adapt it to their context.</p>
<p>Scrum is deliberately <strong>incomplete</strong>.It doesn’t provide
detailed instructions, but instead provides a structure to guide
interactions and relationships.</p>
<p>Scrum can be used alongside or around existing practices, processes
and frameworks.</p>
<p>Just as important as the visible elements of Scrum, such as the Scrum
Team Roles, Events and Artifacts, are the underlying values and
philosophy of Scrum. For Scrum to work effectively, you need to adopt a
mindset and way of working that is underpinned by certain values and
actions.</p>
<p>These are defined in the Scrum Guide as the Principles, Values and
Pillars.</p>
<p>They can be depicted as a temple with the key principles of
Empiricism and Lean Thinking as the foundations, the Values as the
steps, and the Pillars holding up the roof of the temple. The Scrum
Events (i.e. everything that happens in the Sprint) can be thought of as
part of the ‘roof’, and will only run effectively when the pillars,
steps, and foundations are in place.</p>

<p>There are two key principles of Scrum Theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Empiricism</strong>: Decisions are based on observation and
experience, not speculation. Work is guided by evidence and continuous
learning.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lean Thinking</strong>: Focus on delivering value while
eliminating waste i.e. doing only what matters most.</li>

<p>Scrum isn’t only about what is done but how it is done. Scrum has
five values that encourage a healthy and productive working environment.
These guide the Scrum Team’s work, actions and behaviour.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Commitment - the Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and
supporting each other</li>
<li>Focus - the primary focus of the Scrum Team is the work of the
sprint to make the best possible progress toward the Sprint Goal.</li>
<li>Openness - the Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the
work and the challenges. This builds trust and surfaces problems
early.</li>
<li>Respect - Every team member is valued as capable and autonomous.
Scrum works best in an environment of mutual respect.</li>
<li>Courage - Scrum Team members need courage to tackle hard problems
and speak truthfully.</li>
</ol>
<p>Scrum isn’t just a set of meetings and roles. Scrum only works when
the team truly adopts the values it was built to support.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of Scrum relies on three core pillars, which are
built on top of the foundations of Empiricism and Lean Thinking, and the
steps of Scrum Values:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Transparency:</strong> the process and work must be
visible to those performing the work and stakeholders. Transparency is
essential for effective inspection and adaptation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inspection:</strong> the progress toward goals must be
inspected to detect problems quickly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adaptation:</strong> when problems are identified through
inspection, the team must adapt to minimise any further deviation from
the goal.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The pillars are interconnected and each one is critical to Scrum -
without transparency, inspection is misleading. Without inspection,
adaptation is impossible.</p>

<p><strong>Manipulating Burndown Charts</strong></p>
<p>An anecdote of Scrum ineffectiveness from Scrum.org describes how a
team deliberately altered their burndown chart to align exactly with the
ideal progress line on the chart. The Scrum Team said that they were
“manipulating the numbers so that the management does not bother
them”.</p>
<p>The empirical data was falsified, going against one of the key
principles of Scrum theory. This meant that the Scrum Team and wider
organisation couldn’t accurately inspect or adapt, making Sprint
Planning and Review totally ineffective activities.</p>
<p><strong>Horizon IT British Post Office Scandal</strong></p>
<p>The Post Office’s Horizon accounting software, introduced in 1999,
contained numerous bugs (e.g., duplicating ledger entries, phantom
shortfalls) that erroneously implicated hundreds of subpostmasters in
fraud.</p>
<p>The software company Fujitsu and the Post Office were aware of these
serious issues as early as 1999–2002 but concealed them from the public,
subpostmasters, and even prosecution courts. They denied errors and
pressured individuals to cover unexplained deficits, while claiming
system reliability in court.</p>
<p>This highlights the disastrous consequences that a lack of
transparency can have.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Designing a Board Game: The Solent Voyage</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Imagine you have an idea to create a board game ‘The Solent Voyage’,
about a ship that sailed from Southampton in Roman times.</p>
<p>The Product Goal is like your big vision:</p>
<p>“Create a complete, balanced, and fun strategy board game that 4
friends can play in under an hour.”</p>
<p>You may not know all the mechanics or artwork details yet, but you
know what success looks like: something playable, sharable, and maybe
even publishable.</p>
<p>The Product Backlog is your ever-evolving list of features and
ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create player roles and abilities</li>
<li>Draft simple turn mechanics for the game</li>
<li>Design custom mechanics for each role’s combat, trade, and
movement</li>
<li>Write the a comprehensive rulebook</li>
<li>Decide win/lose conditions</li>
<li>Sketch a rough paper game board</li>
<li>Design custom artwork for the board</li>
<li>Print the game board onto high quality material</li>
<li>Create quick example cards</li>
<li>Design and print cards</li>
<li>Build a scoring system</li>
<li>Run a short 20-minute test with two players</li>
<li>Run a full test with four players</li>
<li>Gather feedback from players</li>
<li>Create custom miniatures for each character</li>
</ul>
<p>Some items are critical (like the rules), others are stretch goals
(like custom miniatures). The backlog helps your team stay focused on
building toward the big idea.</p>

<p>The Sprint Backlog is the game plan for the current block of work and
is created at the start of each Sprint, during the Sprint Planning
Meeting. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Sprint Goal.</li>
<li>A subset of the items from the Product Backlog that will be worked
on during this Sprint.</li>
<li>An actionable plan for delivering a working increment by the end of
the Sprint.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sprint Backlog is owned and maintained by the Developers. It is
likely to evolve as the team learns more about the current work but
should always stay grounded in the Sprint Goal.</p>

<h3 id="commitment-sprint-goal">Commitment: Sprint Goal<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#commitment-sprint-goal"></a>

<p>You’re not building the whole game at once - during the first Sprint,

<p>For example, your Sprint Goal might be: “Test the basic turn system

<p>From this Sprint Goal you would create your Sprint Backlog, which
would include all the tasks needed to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>If you completed all the items in the Sprint Backlog, you would still
be far from achieving the Product Goal, but your Sprint Goal is a
stepping stone in the right direction.</p>

<p>A Sprint in Scrum is a fixed-length event, usually between one week
and one month in length. All work that is needed to achieve the Product
Goal is contained within Sprints.</p>
<p>There are four Scrum Events within a Sprint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sprint Planning Meeting</li>
<li>Daily Scrum Meeting</li>
<li>Sprint Review</li>
<li>Sprint Retrospective</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the Scrum Events are designed to enable transparency and to
give formal opportunities to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts.</p>

</h2>
<figure><img src="../fig/scrum_planning.png" alt="diagram of scrum events and artifacts with sprint planning highlighted" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The Sprint Planning Meeting is the kickoff meeting for the Sprint.
During this meeting the Scrum Team will decide what’s most important,
how much can realistically get done, and how you’ll make it happen.</p>
<p>The Product Owner, Scrum Master and Developers all attend the Sprint
Planning meeting. Other people may also be invited to attend to provide
advice.</p>
<p>Sprint Planning needs to answer three questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Why is this Sprint valuable?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Product Owner explains how this Sprint will add value. For
example, what improvements or new features will benefit the users.</li>
<li>Based on this, the Scrum Team collaboratively decides on the Sprint
Goal, which should be a single, unifying goal for the Sprint.</li>
<li>The Sprint Goal must be finalised before the end of the Sprint
Planning Meeting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>What can be Done this Sprint?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Next, the Developers work with the Product Owner to select the
highest-priority Product Backlog items that they feel confident they can
complete. This might involve refining or breaking down the items to make
sure the whole Scrum Team knows what’s involved.</li>
<li>Estimating the amount of work that will fit into one Sprint can be
difficult but basing the estimates on past performance, upcoming
capacity and the Definition of Done can improve the accuracy of
estimates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>How will the chosen work get done?</strong>
<ul>
<li>For each item selected from the Product Backlog, the Developers plan
the specific tasks needed to turn ideas into a working Increment.</li>
<li>Often, Developers will break large items into smaller, more
manageable chunks that will take one day or less.</li>
<li>The Developers decide how to do the work. The Developers are in
charge of this, no one else can tell them how to build the
solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The output from your Sprint Planning Meeting should be your Sprint
Backlog including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Sprint Goal</li>
<li>The subset of items from the Product Backlog that you will work on
this Sprint</li>
<li>A plan for delivering the Increment by the end of the Sprint</li>
</ul>
<p>A Sprint Planning Meeting should be an absolute maximum of eight
hours for a one month Sprint, and should be shorter for shorter Sprints.
Time-boxing the meeting keeps the discussion focussed and allows the
Scrum Team to start making delivering value fast.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Read the following scenario about the Puppy Playdate Planner app and
discuss the questions at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Sprint Planning Meeting Scenario</strong></p>
<p>Imagine your Scrum Team is working on the Puppy Playdate Planner app.
The Product Goal is: “Help puppy owners connect and organise playdates
easily.”</p>
<p>During Sprint Planning, the team agreed on this Sprint Goal: “Enable
creation of puppy profiles and the functionality to search for nearby
puppies.”</p>
<p>They selected these Product Backlog items for the Sprint:</p>
<ul>
<li>Puppy profiles (breed, age, personality, photo upload)</li>
<li>Location-based search for nearby puppy owners</li>
<li>Basic UI for profile creation and search results</li>
</ul>
<p>The Developers planned these tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design user interface wireframes and mockups</li>
<li>Develop backend APIs for profiles and search</li>
<li>Implement photo upload and location filtering</li>
<li>Write unit and integration tests</li>
<li>Conduct peer reviews and usability testing</li>
</ul>
<p>The Scrum Master noticed that the team did not discuss messaging or
playdate scheduling features and expressed concern that the Product
Owner hadn’t clarified their priority or timing.</p>
<p>Some Developers were unsure how much work they could complete due to
unfamiliarity with the photo upload and location technologies.</p>
<p>The Scrum Master reminded the team to consider the Definition of Done
and ensure the Increment would be fully integrated and tested.</p>

<li>Surface and solve problems faster</li>
<li>Make quick decisions</li>
<li>Reduce the need for additional meetings</li>
<li>Keep momentum going with clear next steps</li>
</ul>
<p>This meeting should usually last no longer than 15 minutes and is
usually held in the same time and place every working day of the Sprint.
The Daily Scrum can take any structure and use any techniques as long as
it focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces a plan for
the next day of work.</p>
<p>Usually each developer would cover: - What you did yesterday - What
you plan to do today - Anything that’s blocking you</p>
<p>During a Daily Scrum Meeting, focus on exchanging information with
others in the group not just talking about what you’ve been doing.</p>
<p>The Daily Scrum Meeting isn’t the only time that Developers can
discuss and adjust their plans. Developers can also meet throughout the
day to re-adjust plans or to have more detailed discussions.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>In this challenge, you’re going to practice conducting a Daily Scrum
Meeting in groups of four.</p>
<p>Assign one person to the Scrum Master role, they are responsible for
keeping the meeting to time and ensuring everyone get a chance to say
everything they need to. The whole meeting must be under five minutes
long.</p>
<p>Assign the three other group members to developer roles: Developer 1,
Developer 2, or Developer 3.</p>
<p>Each developer should read the information under their section below
but none of the others. This information may be important to others in
the Scrum Team.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the developers should exchange information so
that all developers end the meeting with no blockers, a clear plan for
their day and are aware of any dependencies or issues.</p>

flow for the Scrum Team.</li>
<li>One person should role play as the Product Owner. You should
represent the interests of the client throughout the meeting.</li>
<li>The rest of the group should be developers. The Scrum Master and

<p><strong>Questions for Sprint Planning</strong></p>
<p>Remember to answer the following questions during the Sprint Planning
Meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is this Sprint valuable?</li>
<li>What can be Done this Sprint?</li>
<li>How will the chosen work get Done?</li>
</ul>
<p>The output from your Sprint Planning Meeting should be your Sprint
Backlog including: - A Sprint Goal - The subset of items from the
Product Backlog that you will work on this Sprint - A plan for
delivering the Increment by the end of the Sprint</p>
