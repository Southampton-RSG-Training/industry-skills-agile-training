- A mentor provides structure, guidance, and advice to assist the mentee to achieve their goals
- Prior to beginning a mentorship, work to identify the areas in your work (or team) that you wish to improve or learn more about
- Work with a mentor to develop achievable goals that you (or team) will work towards

FIXME: successful projects create positive environments of knowledge exchange and learning; scrum pillar - openness about work and challenges; types of learning e.g. collaborative, training, mentorship (traditional senior/junior, and peer-to-peer)

FIXME: what is mentorship, roles in mentorship, why mentorship matters, typical mentorship activities

FIXME: how mentorship typically works, typical flow of mentorship in practice

FIXME: keys to successful mentorship

FIXME: practical, two parts: 1. based on findings from sprint 1 reflection, decide as a group on strengths and weaknesses as a team, decide what areas team wants to improve; 2. have meeting with mentor, discuss areas of improvement and decide on a set of three goals for improvement as a team (approx.), and how this will be done in the next sprint

FIXME: practical: refine updated backlog (if needed) based on suggestions (does this make sense?)
