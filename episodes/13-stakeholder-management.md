## User Stories: Understanding Requirements from the User Perspective

Capturing requirements is pivotal to understanding what needs to be built,
but whilst they state what is required, they lack the end-user context of what they are and why they are important.
User stories aim to capture this perspective, being short and simple descriptions of new features or functionality from the perspective of the end user themselves.
Therefore, user stories help:

- The project remains *user-centered* and *focused on real needs*,
rather than jumping prematurely to solution or technical requirements
- To clarify the the *value* behind a feature,
and anchor development in *user outcomes*, not just functionality
- Prevent requirements ballooning, if not guided by real user goals
- Prioritise what matters to users

They typically follow the following template,
to ensure user stories are clear and concise:

> As a *[type of user]*, I want *[an action]* so that *[benefit]*.

Breaking each of these three aspects down:

- "As a *[type of user]*": who are we building this for? There may be more than one type of user, but in any case we need to think about this from the user's perspective.
- "I want *[an action]*": this describes the intent of this type of user, not the features of the system. What do they want to achieve?
- "so that *[benefit]*": what is the benefit they are trying to realise? How will it help them directly, solve a problem for them?

Some examples of user stories include:

- E-commerce site: as a shopper, I want to add items to my cart so that I can purchase multiple products at once
- Mobile application: as a user, I want to receive push notifications for important updates so that I stay informed when I'm not using the app

## Solo Exercise: User Stories

Consider this scenario:

*"A small town cheese-making business has received many enquiries about being able to make online purchases delivered to their homes or place of business,
and so now want to also sell their many types of cheeses using an online store.
Online customers are looking to be able to search the store, select cheeses to purchase,
and when ready, add payment and shipping details and confirm the order.
There is some evidence that some online customers are environmentally and ecologically conscious,
so are interested in the environmental impacts of products.
In order to schedule their supply chains efficiently, business customers are keen to have updates on shipping.
From the perspective of the business owner, they want to able to manage available stock inventory on the online store."

Identify at least two types of user - also known as *personas* - that would use the store.
From the above scenario, create at least four user stories using this format:

> As a *[type of user]*, I want *[an action]* so that *[benefit]*.

Hint: focus on the user needs, not what may be implementated.

:::::::::::::::  solution

Here are some example user stories:

Business owner:
- As a business owner, I want to add new stock to the sit,e so that customers can purchase it.
- As a business owner, I want to remove old stock from the site, so that customers cannot purchase expired stock.

Personal customer:
- As a customer, I want to search available cheeses by name, so I can find the ones I want easily.
- As a customer, I want to add cheeses to a basket, so I can continue to shop and purchase them all later.

Eco-conscious customer:
- As an eco-conscious customer, I want to view the environmental impact details of products, so I can make environmentally-informed purchasing choices.

Business customer:
- As a business customer, I want to have real-time updates of orders that have been shipped, so I can organise my supply chains efficiently.

## What Exactly is a Requirement, and Why are they Important?

In general, a requirement is a *capability or condition that must be met for software to solve a problem or address a need*.
They form the foundation of our project and drive what will be developed,
so if we do not properly explore and understand what is required, the software will not be suitable for it's intended purpose.
Whilst user stories focus purely on the user perspective,
requirements concentrate on the technical aspects of building a product that meets these needs.
For this reason, it's common to develop user stories first (to understand the user),
then from those stories, derive requirements (to understand what needs to be built).

FIXME: add in SWC slide references to importance of reqs and stats for failure, with examples (e.g. galileo probe)

However, it is unlikely that we will be able to determine all of the requirements correctly and completely upfront.
In practice, very often requirements may need be flexible to some extent and may change as the project evolves, so we need to ensure we are able to accommodate any agreed changes.

## Requirements are More than just Features

When considering software requirements, it is very tempting to just think about the features users need. 
However, many design choices in a software project depend on the users themselves and the environment in which the software is expected to run (as well as *how* the software should run),
and these aspects should be considered as part of the softwareâ€™s *non-functional* requirements.

To explore the importance of this aspect, let's consider two software types, mobile applications and embedded software.
They may appear similar, but examining the environments in which they are developed and operate uncovers many differences that need to be accounted for in order for the software to be fit for purpose.

| Concern   | Mobile Apps | Embedded Software
|-----------|-------------|------------------
| Platform | Work on range of mobile hardware and iOS/Android operating systems | Exact specification of hardware is known - often not necessary to support multiple devices; typically low power
| Development Language | Typically written in one of the higher-level platform preferred languages (e.g. Java, Kotlin, Swift) | Typically lower-level language (e.g. C) for better control of resources
| Compilation | Users will not (usually) modify / compile the software | Users will not (usually) modify / compile the software
| Installation | Usually distributed via a controlled app store | Usually distributed pre-installed on a physical device
| Interface | Must have graphical interface suitable for a touch display | May have no user interface, or interface may be physical buttons
| Documentation | Probably in the software itself or on a Web page | Documentation probably in a technical manual with a separate user manual
| Uptime | May not run continuously due to restarts | May need to run continuously for the lifetime of the device

Therefore, whilst a single piece of software may provide the same *functionality* on a mobile app or embedded device (for example, a photo frame application),
the other *non-functional* considerations describe facets of how the software must be developed and how it must operate (often as constraints),
and we must account for them in our requirements.

## Solo Exercise: Types of Software

Think about some software you are familiar with
(could be software you have written yourself or by someone else)
and how the environment it is used in has affected its design or development.
Here are some examples of questions you can use to get started:

- What environment does the software run in?
- How do people interact with it?
- What features of the software have been affected by these factors?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Some Examples

Desktop Application
- Has a graphical interface for use with mouse and keyboard
- May need to work on multiple, very different operating systems
- May be intended for users to modify / compile themselves
- Should work on a wide range of hardware configurations
- Documentation probably either in a manual or in the software itself

Command-line Application - Linux Tool
- User interface is text based, probably via command-line arguments
- Intended to be modified / compiled by users - though most will choose not to
- Documentation has standard formats - also accessible from the command line
- Should be usable as part of a pipeline

Command-line Application - High Performance Computing
- Similar to a UNIX Tool
- Usually supports running across multiple networked machines simultaneously
- Usually operated via a scheduler - interface should be scriptable
- May need to run on a wide range of hardware
  (e.g. different CPU architectures)
- May need to process large amounts of data
- Often entirely or partially written in a lower-level language for performance
  (e.g. C, C++, Fortran)

Web Application
- Usually has components which run on server and components which run on the user's device
- Graphical interface should usually support both Desktop and Mobile devices
- Client-side component should run on a range of browsers and operating systems
- Documentation probably part of the software itself
- Client-side component typically written in JavaScript

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

There are many categories of non-functional requirements,
but some popular examples include:

- Security: how do we ensure a user is authenticated and authorised to conduct a particular action?
- Performance: what performance goals will the software be required to satisfy?
- Usability: how will the user interact with the software?
- Portability: to what extent should the software be able to run on different systems with minimal changes?
- Reliability: to what extent should the software we able to operate without errors and unexpected failures?
- Availability: to what extent should the software remain accessible and operational when needed?
