The Sprint Retrospective is a reflective session for the Scrum Team only to inspect what went well and what could be improved from the previous Sprint.

The Sprint Retrospective:

-   Is the last event of the Sprint - held after the Sprint Review but before the next Sprint Planning Meeting.
-   Focuses on inspection of team collaboration, tools, processes and anything else that affected the Sprint to identify any changes that can improve effectiveness. 
-   Addresses any assumptions that led the team away from the Product Goal and determines where they came from. 

- How to measure effort and improve predictions for the next sprint
