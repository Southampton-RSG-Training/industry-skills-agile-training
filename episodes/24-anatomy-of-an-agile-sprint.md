# Events of a Sprint

A Sprint in Scrum is a fixed-length event, usually between one week and one month in length.
All work that is needed to achieve the Product Goal is contained within Sprints.

There are four Scrum Events within a Sprint: - Sprint Planning Meeting - Daily Scrum Meeting - Sprint Review - Sprint Retrospective

All of the Scrum Events are designed to enable transparency and to give formal opportunities to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts.

## Sprint Planning Meeting

The Sprint Planning Meeting is the kickoff meeting for the Sprint.
During this meeting the Scrum Team will decide what's most important, how much can realistically get done, and how you'll make it happen.

The Product Owner, Scrum Master and Developers all attend the Sprint Planning meeting.
Other people may also be invited to attend to provide advice.

Sprint Planning needs to answer three questions:

1.  **Why is this Sprint valuable?**
    -   The Product Owner explains how this Sprint will add value. For example, what improvements or new features will benefit the users.
    -   Based on this, the Scrum Team collaboratively decides on the Sprint Goal, which should be a single, unifying goal for the Sprint.
    -   The Sprint Goal must be finalised before the end of the Sprint Planning Meeting.
2.  **What can be Done this Sprint?**
    -   Next, the Developers work with the Product Owner to select the highest-priority Product Backlog items that they feel confident they can complete. This might involve refining or breaking down the items to make sure the whole Scrum Team knows what's involved.
    -   Estimating the amount of work that will fit into one Sprint can be difficult but basing the estimates on past performance, upcoming capacity and the Definition of Done can improve the accuracy of estimates.
3.  **How will the chosen work get done?**
    -   For each item selected from the Product Backlog, the Developers plan the specific tasks needed to turn ideas into a working Increment.
    -   Often, Developers will break large items into smaller, more manageable chunks that will take one day or less.
    -   The Developers decide how to do the work. The Developers are in charge of this, no one else can tell them how to build the solution.
    -   The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, and the plan for delivering them are collectively referred to as the Sprint Backlog.

A Sprint Planning Meeting should be an absolute maximum of eight hours for a one month Sprint, and should be shorter for shorter Sprints.
Time-boxing the meeting keeps the discussion focussed and allows the Scrum Team to start making delivering value fast.

## Tips for a successful Sprint Planning Meeting

-   The Product Owner should come prepared with a prioritised Product Backlog and ideas about the goal for the Sprint.
-   Everyone should contribute to the Sprint Planning Meeting for the Sprint Backlog to feel like it is owned by the whole Scrum Team.
-   Developers should be realistic about what they can achieve - it's better to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around!
-   Keep the Definition of Done in mind to avoid surprises later.

## Dog Playdate Planner

(Discuss in small groups)

Read the following Sprint Planning summary from a fictional Scrum Team working on the Dog Playdate Planner app.
Then answer the questions below.

**Scenario**

Your Scrum Team is working on the Dog Playdate Planner app.
The Product Goal is: “Help dog owners connect and organise playdates easily.”

During Sprint Planning, the team agreed on this Sprint Goal: “Enable creation of dog profiles and the functionality to search for nearby dogs.”

They selected these Product Backlog items for the Sprint:

-   Dog profiles (breed, age, personality, photo upload)
-   Location-based search for nearby dog owners
-   Basic UI for profile creation and search results

The Developers planned these tasks:

-   Design UI wireframes and mockups
-   Develop backend APIs for profiles and search
-   Implement photo upload and location filtering
-   Write unit and integration tests
-   Conduct peer reviews and usability testing

The Scrum Master noticed that the team did not discuss messaging or playdate scheduling features and expressed concern that the Product Owner hadn’t clarified their priority or timing.

Some Developers were unsure how much work they could complete due to unfamiliarity with the photo upload and location technologies.

The Scrum Master reminded the team to consider the Definition of Done and ensure the Increment would be fully integrated and tested.

**Questions**

1.   What aspects of the Sprint Planning went well?
2.   What important elements were missing or could be improved?
3.   Why is it important to discuss features like messaging and scheduling during Sprint Planning?
4.   How could the Sprint Goal be reframed to focus more on delivering user value?
5.   What would you recommend for the team to do differently in the next Sprint Planning session?

::: solution

**1. What aspects of the Sprint Planning went well?**

- Clear Sprint Goal aligned with the Product Goal.  
- Thoughtful breakdown of Product Backlog items into concrete tasks.  
- Inclusion of testing and peer reviews highlights focus on quality.  
- Scrum Master emphasised the Definition of Done, reinforcing standards.  
- Open discussion of team capacity and challenges with new technologies.

**2. What important elements were missing or could be improved?**

- Messaging and scheduling features were not addressed or prioritised.  
- Lack of Product Owner clarity on feature prioritisation and roadmap.  
- No plan to manage risks related to unfamiliar technologies.  
- Missing discussion on dependencies or backlog refinement status.  
- No mitigation strategy for uncertainties in capacity estimation.

**3. Why is it important to discuss features like messaging and scheduling during Sprint Planning?**

- They are core features critical to the app’s success and user satisfaction.  
- Early discussion ensures prioritisation aligns with business goals and stakeholder expectations.  
- Helps identify dependencies and plan future Sprints effectively.  
- Avoids last-minute surprises or bottlenecks later in development.

**4. How could the Sprint Goal be reframed to focus more on delivering user value?**

- Instead of focusing on features, express the goal in terms of user outcomes, for example:  
  *“Allow dog owners to create profiles and easily find playdate partners nearby to start connecting.”*  
- This keeps the team focused on the why, not just the what.

**5. What would you recommend for the team to do differently in the next Sprint Planning session?**

- Collaborate with the Product Owner to clarify backlog priorities and feature timelines.  
- Include backlog refinement updates to ensure readiness of items.  
- Plan for risk management and capacity uncertainties, possibly with technical spikes.  
- Discuss dependencies and integration challenges.  
- Encourage open communication and adjustment of the Definition of Done if needed.
