## Running an Effective Sprint 

- Video from RSEs about how to conduct effective sprints and work effectively in a team

A Sprint is a focused period of work during which the Scrum Team collaborates to deliver a usable increment of the product. Success depends on clear communication, taking shared ownership for the product, and steady progress toward the Sprint Goal.

Tasks should be distributed so that everyone can contribute effectively. This does not mean assigning all work at the start and working in isolation. Team members should communicate regularly, help each other when needed, and adjust plans as the Sprint progresses.

Before getting started on the work today, hold a short Daily Scrum Meeting to make sure everyone knows what they're working on and no one has any problems blocking them from getting started.

## Group Exercise: Daily Scrum Meeting

(10 minutes)

In your team, review the Sprint 1 Backlog and discuss:

- Which issue will each person begin working on?
- Are there any dependencies between tasks?
- Does everyone have a clear starting point?

Make sure each team member selects at least one issue to begin working on.

## Reminder - Feature Branch Workflow

Remember each task in the Sprint Backlog should correspond to a GitHub issue. When working on an issue:

- Create a new feature branch for that issue
- Implement the required changes
- Submit a pull request for review
- One of your colleagues reviews the pull request
- Respond to feedback and make any required changes
- Once approved, merge the pull request and close the issue

## Coffee Beans Analysis Project Sprint 1 


You will now begin Sprint 1.

You will have **3 hours** to work collaboratively to deliver an Increment that you can demonstrate to the client. Focus on making steady, visible progress and communicating regularly with your team.



:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- A Sprint is a focused, collaborative effort to deliver a working increment toward the Sprint Goal.
- Work should be organised using issues, feature branches, and pull requests to ensure safe and reviewable changes.
- Regular communication helps teams to stay on track and resolve problems quickly.
- Completing and reviewing issues incrementally helps ensure steady progress and a successful Sprint outcome.
