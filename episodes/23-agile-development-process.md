# Scrum Philosophy

::: callout
*'Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems'* - The Scrum Guide
:::

Scrum is intentionally minimalist.
It defines only what is essential to implement Scrum theory, encouraging teams to build on it and adapt it to their context.
Think of Scrum not as a complete recipe, but as a flexible scaffolding that helps teams navigate complexity.

Scrum is deliberately incomplete.
It doesn't provide detailed instructions, but instead provides a structure to guide interactions and relationships.

### Key Principles of Scrum Theory

-   **Empiricism**: Decisions are based on observation and experience, not speculation. Work is guided by evidence and continuous learning.
-   **Lean Thinking**: Focus on delivering value while eliminating waste i.e. doing only what matters most.

Scrum can be used alongside or around existing practices, processes and frameworks.
Scrum is designed to make clear the effectiveness of existing working techniques.

Scrum is an iterative, incremental approach.
It aims to reduce risk and increase predictability.

:::: challenge
1.  It is intentionally \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, meaning it provides only the essential structure and leaves room for adaptation.
2.  Scrum is based on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, which means knowledge comes from experience and decisions are based on observation.
3.  It also draws on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ thinking, which emphasizes reducing waste and maximizing value.
4.  Scrum is both \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, allowing teams to inspect and adapt regularly.

1.  incomplete
2.  empiricism

4.  iterative, incremental

# Scrum Pillars

(Picture of pillars)

The effectiveness of Scrum relies on three core pillars that support its empirical foundation:

1.  **Transparency:** the process and work must be visible to those performing the work and stakeholders.
    Transparency is essential for effective inspection and adaptation.

2.  **Inspection:** the progress toward goals must be inspected to detect problems quickly.

3.  **Adaptation:** when problems are identified through inspection, the team must adapt to minimise any further deviation from the goal.

::: callout
**Without transparency, inspection is misleading. Without inspection, adaptation is impossible.**

The pillars are interconnected and each one is critical to Scrum.

::: discussion
What’s an example of “transparency” you’ve seen—or failed to see—in a previous project?
How did it affect the outcome?

# Scrum Values

Scrum isn't only about what is done but how it is done.
Scrum has five values that encourage a healthy and productive working environment.
These guide the Scrum Team's work, actions and behaviour.

1.  Commitment - the Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and supporting each other
2.  Focus - the primary focus of the Scrum Team is the work of the sprint to make the best possible progress toward the Sprint Goal.
3.  Openness - the Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges. This builds trust and surfaces problems early.
4.  Respect - Every team member is valued as capable and autonomous. Scrum works best in an environment of mutual respect.
5.  Courage - Scrum Team members need courage to tackle hard problems and speak truthfully.

::: callout
*“Scrum is the framework I built to put those values into practice. There is no methodology.”* - Jeff Sutherland (co-creator of Scrum)
:::

Scrum isn't just a set of meetings and roles.
Scrum only works when the team truly adopts the values it was built to support.

::: discussion
Which Scrum Value do you think you would find hardest to practice?
Why?
How could a team support each other in developing it?
:::

# Scrum Team

The Scrum Team has a simple structure, with no sub-teams and no hierarchies, just one self-managing unit working toward a common goal.

A Scrum Team includes:

-   Developers (usually 3-9 people)
-   One Product Owner
-   One Scrum Master

::: callout
**Why no hierarchy?** Because Agile processes do best when teams make decisions and adapt quickly, without waiting for permission from higher-ups.
:::

## Developers

In a software development project, most developers will probably be software engineers, but developers could also be designers, testers, data analysts or any other role doing work to turn ideas into a working product.

-   They are **committed to quality**, and collectively responsible for delivering Done work.
-   They decide **how** to accomplish the Sprint Goal.
-   They collaborate, inspect, and adapt.

You could think of developers as the engine of the team.

(Picture of engine)

## Product Owner

The Product Owner is responsible for maximising the value delivered by the Scrum Team.
The Product Owner is one single person, but they may represent a group of clients or other stakeholders.

-   Owns and manages the Product Backlog by ordering and refining it to ensure clarity for the rest of the Team
-   Represents the user perspective and works according to the business goals for the product.
-   Decides what gets built next but not how it gets built

You could think of the Product Owner as the compass, ensuring that the Scrum Team is always pointing toward the highest-value outcome.

(Picture of compass)

## Scrum Master

The Scrum Master ensures that the Scrum framework is understood and carried out correctly.

-   A servant leader, not a manager or a taskmaster.

-   Helps the team to remove blockers, improve flow, and reflect on what has gone well and what could be improved.

-   Supports the Scrum Team in applying Scrum effectively.

You could think of the Scrum Master as a coach, empowering the Scrum Team to work as effectively as possible.

(Picture of encouraging coach)

::: challenge
## Developer, Product Owner or Scrum Master - Which Role would you Choose?

(Discuss in pairs)

Imagine you’ve just joined a new Scrum Team.
You’re given the choice to fill one of the three roles.
Which would you choose and why?

Consider:

-   Which role best matches your strengths, interests, or career goals?
-   What skills or mindset would you need to succeed in that role?
-   What challenges might you face in the role and how would you handle them?

# Scrum Artifacts and Commitments

The Scrum Artifacts are the Scrum Team's source of truth.
They make visible what's being worked on, why it matters, and how close you are to delivering value.

There are three key artifacts, each with a commitment that helps to keep the team focused and aligned.

## Product Backlog

A Product Backlog is like a wishlist for the product.
It's a master to-do list that is strategic and adaptable.

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything the product might need including features, fixes, experiments, and improvements.
It evolves constantly based on things like feedback, market shifts, and changing stakeholder goals.

-   The Product Backlog belongs to the Product Owner, but anyone can contribute ideas.
-   Helps the team to understand what might come next in the product's development.
-   Refined continuously so that items are clear, provide value and ready when needed.

### Commitment: Product Goal

The Product Goal is the long-term vision for the product, a clear destination that the team is moving toward over time.

::: callout
## Designing a Board Game: The Solent Voyage

Imagine you have an idea to create a board game 'The Solent Voyage', about a ship that sailed from Southampton in Roman times.

The Product Goal is like your big vision:

“Create a complete, balanced, and fun strategy board game that 4 friends can play in under an hour.”

You may not know all the mechanics or artwork details yet, but you know what success looks like: something playable, sharable, and maybe even publishable.

The Product Backlog is your ever-evolving list of features and ideas:

-   Design core mechanics (combat, trade, movement)
-   Create player roles and abilities
-   Write the rules
-   Sketch the game board
-   Design and print cards
-   Build a scoring system
-   Test it out with real people
-   Create custom miniatures for each character
-   Add artwork and polish

Some items are critical (like the rules), others are stretch goals (like custom miniatures).
The backlog helps your team stay focused on building toward the big idea.
:::

## Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is the game plan for the current block of work and is created at the start of each Sprint, during the Sprint Planning Meeting.
It includes:

-   A subset of the items from the Product Backlog.
-   An actionable plan for delivering a working increment by the end of the Sprint.

The Sprint Backlog is owned and maintained by the Developers.
It is likely to evolve as the team learns more about the current work but should always stay grounded in the Sprint Goal.

### Commitment: Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal is a single objective for the current Sprint and should be the primary focus of the Scrum Team.

::: callout
## The Start of the Solent Voyage

You’re not building the whole game at once - during the first Sprint, you’re aiming for a step towards the overall goal.

For example, your Sprint Goal might be: “Test the basic turn system with 2 players using paper placeholders.”

Your Sprint Backlog includes all the tasks needed to get there:

-   Draft simple turn mechanics
-   Create quick example cards
-   Sketch a rough paper game board
-   Decide win/lose conditions
-   Run a short 20-minute test
-   Gather feedback from players

If you completed all the items in the Sprint Backlog, you would still be far from achieving the Product Goal, but your Sprint Goal is a stepping stone in the right direction.
:::

## Increment

The Increment is the result of the Scrum Team's work during the Sprint and is a working, usable part of the product that meets any quality criteria that have been agreed.

The Increment should be: - Integrated with the rest of the product - Tested - Reviewed\
- Potentially releasable

The Increment includes the sum of all previous Increments and so it increases in value after every Sprint.

### Commitment: Definition of Done

The Definition of Done is a a formal description of the state that the Increment should be in to meet the quality measures required for the product

You could think of the increment as being like a brick in a wall.
The Definition of Done would be a checklist to ensure that the brick is strong, stable, and usable in the wall.

::: callout
## The Maiden Voyage

At the end of the Sprint, your team has a working prototype.
The artwork might be rough and the game play might be unbalanced, but it can be played and evaluated.

That's your Increment: an overly simple and incomplete, but usable version of the game that brings you closer to your Product Goal.

The Definition of Done in this case might be:

-   The rules are clear enough to play without additional explanation.
-   The components labelled and functional.
-   The test players complete a game.
-   Any bugs or confusing moments were documented.

Only if the Increment meets the Definition of Done will it become part of the growing, evolving game.
Next Sprint, you might improve the experience further, possibly by expanding the the map area for the game, balancing roles, or designing better cards.
