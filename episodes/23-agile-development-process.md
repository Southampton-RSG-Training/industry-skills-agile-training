# Scrum Philosophy

::: callout
*'Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems'* - The Scrum Guide
:::

Scrum is intentionally minimalist.
It defines only what is essential to implement Scrum theory, encouraging teams to build on it and adapt it to their context.
Think of Scrum not as a complete recipe, but as a flexible scaffolding that helps teams navigate complexity.

Scrum is deliberately incomplete.
It doesn't provide detailed instructions, but instead provides a structure to guide interactions and relationships.

### Key Principles of Scrum Theory

-   **Empiricism**: Decisions are based on observation and experience, not speculation. Work is guided by evidence and continuous learning.
-   **Lean Thinking**: Focus on delivering value while eliminating waste i.e. doing only what matters most.

Scrum can be used alongside or around existing practices, processes and frameworks.
Scrum is designed to make clear the effectiveness of existing working techniques.

Scrum is an iterative, incremental approach.
It aims to reduce risk and increase predictability.

# Scrum Pillars

The effectiveness of Scrum relies on three core pillars that support its empirical foundation:

1.  **Transparency:** the process and work must be visible to those performing the work and stakeholders.
    Transparency is essential for effective inspection and adaptation.

2.  **Inspection:** the progress toward goals must be inspected to detect problems quickly.

3.  **Adaptation:** when problems are identified through inspection, the team must adapt to minimise any further deviation from the goal.

**Without transparency, inspection is misleading. Without inspection, adaptation is impossible.**

The pillars are interconnected and each one is critical to Scrum.

# Scrum Values

Scrum isn't only about what is done but how it is done.
Scrum has five values that encourage a healthy and productive working environment.
These guide the Scrum Team's work, actions and behaviour.

1.  Commitment - the Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and supporting each other
2.  Focus - the primary focus of the Scrum Team is the work of the sprint to make the best possible progress toward the Sprint Goal.
3.  Openness - the Scrum Team and its stakeholders are open about the work and the challenges. This builds trust and surfaces problems early.
4.  Respect - Every team member is valued as capable and autonomous. Scrum works best in an environment of mutual respect.
5.  Courage - Scrum Team members need courage to tackle hard problems and speak truthfully.

::: callout
*“Scrum is the framework I built to put those values into practice. There is no methodology.”* - Jeff Sutherland (co-creator of Scrum)
:::

Scrum isn't just a set of meetings and roles.
Scrum only works when the team truly adopts the values it was built to support.
